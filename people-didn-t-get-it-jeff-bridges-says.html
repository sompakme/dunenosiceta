Audiences gave it a B CinemaScore. Critics sniffed that it wasn’t as good as Joel and Ethan Coen’s last release, the Oscar-winning Fargo.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But that was just, like, their opinion, man.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I thought it was going to be a big hit,” star <a href=# id=auto-tag_jeff-bridges data-tag=jeff-bridges>Jeff Bridges</a> tells THR, along with sharing some of his personal behind-the-scenes photos from the film’s set, many of which appeared in his 2003 book, Pictures. “I was surprised when it didn’t get much recognition. People didn’t get it, or something.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/JeffBridges_TBL_015-EMBEd-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Coming near the end of the indie cinema wave, Lebowski stood out among the decade’s quirky, quippy crime dramas with a detective tale that upended all the L.A. noir tropes. Its tangled mystery — loosely inspired by Raymond Chandler’s The Big Sleep — didn’t much matter. Its shaggy stoner hero, Bridges’ “The Dude,” was mainly focused on getting his rug back. When characters drew weapons, they were intentionally made to look ridiculous instead of Tarantino-cool.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“There was something attractive about having the main character not be a private eye, but just some pothead intuitively figuring out the ins and outs of an elaborate intrigue,” Ethan Coen once said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When he first read the script, Bridges recalls his surprise at how well he related to the character. “My first impression was it was a great script and I had never done anything like it,” he says. “I thought the brothers must have spied on me when I was in high school.” Half of the Dude’s clothes came from Bridges’ own wardrobe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/JeffBridges_TBL_027-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">That said, Bridges was a bit concerned about playing “this big pothead.” “My daughters were preteen, and I was concerned I would set a bad example,” he says. “Being a child of a celebrity, I know what that’s like for a kid.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A hugely impressive supporting cast signed on that included John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Sam Elliott, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Tara Reid and Philip Seymour Hoffman. While the film’s dialogue might sound like it was the product of at least some improvising, Bridges says the actors stuck extremely close to the Coens’ script.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/JeffBridges_TBL_018-EMBEd-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I remember John and I being concerned about where each ‘man’ was, where each ‘fuck’ was — there was a music to it, and we wanted to make sure we hit all the notes,” Bridges says.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">That said, while he cannot swear to it, he suspects the Dude’s “human paraquat” insult “might have just popped out of my mouth.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The resulting film operated on a delightful vibe all its own and, ever so gradually, the film garnered more and more fans thanks to midnight screenings, cable and home video. More than one critic changed their mind about it, with Roger Ebert adjusting <a href=# rel=nofollow>his review in 2010</a> from three to four (out of four) stars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/JeffBridges_TBL_004-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Superfans (called “Achievers”) have attended an annual Lebowski Fest since 2002, and the film even inspired a religion (Dudeism). Turturro made an unofficial spinoff, The Jesus Rolls, in 2020.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The film has also been a reliable generator of revenue for its studio. According to Universal, the past five years alone have seen Lebowski outgross its original domestic release in home viewing revenue (it has made more than $100 million total).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">For its devotees, and for Bridges himself, there’s something about the film that, well … abides.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I’m so happy to be in that movie,” Bridges says. “I pretty much dug it all, man. There’s an aspect of the Dude I aspired to — he’s authentic, isn’t he? He’s who he is, and that’s about it. He’s a lovely cat.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/JeffBridges_TBL_063-EMBED-2023.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/8endpg-lebowski-tear_EMBED.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A version of this story first appeared in the March 1 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. <a href=#>Click here to subscribe</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8WemK2topp8tbTEZpmin12hsqO71qyiomVianqius2irZ6qo5a%2FunnJnp2fZZKntqWzxKxkampjaoB0gZhybWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./deanna-moyer-missing-philadelphia-pd-seeks-public-help-in-locating-26-year-old-woman-in-germantown.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Deanna Moyer Missing: Philadelphia PD Seeks Public Help In Locating 26-Year-Old Woman In Germantown,</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./i-was-wrong-at-the-top-of-my-lungs-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'I Was Wrong at the Top of My Lungs' (Video)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
