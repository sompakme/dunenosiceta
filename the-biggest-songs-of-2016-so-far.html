But what kicked off the whirlwind was this single, which she dropped by surprise (noticing a trend here?) the night before her explosive set at the Super Bowl Halftime show.

The song was met with so much enthusiasm when it was released, that it gave the Toronto native his first-ever #1 single on the Billboard charts. Not even his prior hits "Hotline Bling" or "Best I Ever Had" had made it that big. The song's popularity becomes obvious in its infectiousness; those dancehall and afrobeat influences make the jam impossible to stop playing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>"Work" by Rihanna feat.

After serving us pop anthems through most of her career, a chiller and Caribbean-inspired track like "Work" seemed an unlikely hit, but it soon won listeners over and stuck.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>"Too Good" by Drake feat.

"She got in the studio and just bodied it. It was like a flawless victory when she sent it back," he said of Rihanna's contribution. The song's premise of being in a relationship kept the artists' romantic past in question. "We have a genuine energy between us," Drake later added.

Though the song's pop-EDM-crossover formula made it destined to become a hit, what really gave it momentum was the buzz over the involvement of Harris' ex, Taylor Swift. It was discovered that she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a16642/taylor-swift-calvin-harris-this-is-what-you-came-for-credit-writing/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wrote the song" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">wrote the song</a> with her former DJ boyfriend under the pen name Nils Sjoberg while they were still together.

Music record label. "Panda," which was ubiquitous by the beginning of summer, proved a great launching pad for Desiigner, who went on to release a debut mixtape, another banger called "Timmy Turner" and even a hook with Travi$ Scott on G.O.O.D. collab, "Champions."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>"Cheap Thrills" by Sia</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">[spotify ]<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://play.spotify.com/track/6b3b7lILUJqXcp6w9wNQSm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=https://play.spotify.com/track/6b3b7lILUJqXcp6w9wN... class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">https://play.spotify.com/track/6b3b7lILUJqXcp6w9wN...</a> [/spotify]</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The talented songwriter might have penned renowned tracks for the likes of Rihanna and Beyoncé, but she knows how to save a hit for herself. Though this song was originally intended for RiRi's Anti album (can you imagine?) Sia did a stellar job popularizing it on her own. The release of a remix with a guest verse by Sean Paul catapulted the song to Sia's first number one spot on Billboard's Hot 100 list. Who knew appealing to penny-pinching millennials would make an instant chart-topper?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>"Closer" by The Chainsmokers feat.

Although the song they wrote about it is much more upbeat than the original, the result was an inescapable hit that's been sitting pretty at the top of the iTunes and Billboard charts since its release. Tapping indie-pop star Halsey for the second verse made it an even more realistic conversation between two (relatable) former lovers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>"Famous" by Kanye West</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">[spotify ]<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://play.spotify.com/track/19a3JfW8BQwqHWUMbcqSx8 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=https://play.spotify.com/track/19a3JfW8BQwqHWUMbcq... class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">https://play.spotify.com/track/19a3JfW8BQwqHWUMbcq...</a> [/spotify]</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">#TeamSwift can protest all it wants, but this song, whether you found it offensive or genius, became the center of so much the pop culture scene in 2016—and developed in stages throughout the year.

Over an incredible gospel-inspired beat (a fitting sound for a rapper who's uniquely vocal about God), Chance teams up with Wayne and 2 Chainz for a catchy "F You" track to record labels, which the yet unsigned artist clearly didn't need to achieve the success he's reached now.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor><span data-redactor-tag=span data-verified=redactor></span>"Into You" by Ariana Grande</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=65 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">[spotify ]<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://play.spotify.com/track/2meEiZKWkiN28gITzFwQo5 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=https://play.spotify.com/track/2meEiZKWkiN28gITzFw... class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">https://play.spotify.com/track/2meEiZKWkiN28gITzFw...</a> [/spotify]</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=67 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although the pop princess teased her new album Dangerous Woman with its seductive title track, what really stuck was this upbeat and equally flirtatious song. You can thank hit machine Max Martin (who penned Grande's "Break Free," and dozens of other recognizable pop songs) for the tune you probably heard at most radio-soundtracked pool parties this summer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=69 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>"Cold Water" by Major Lazer feat.

His lead single proved just that, ushering in a new sound on a track produced by Daft Punk. The song broke records and now boasts the biggest opening weekend in streaming history, but The Weeknd hints in his lyrics that stardom isn't painless—it comes with its consequences.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=87 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>"Send My Love (To Your New Lover)" by Adele</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=89 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">[spotify ]<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://play.spotify.com/track/3LGxef3inmn5jMLGDz9lqw data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=https://play.spotify.com/track/3LGxef3inmn5jMLGDz9... class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">https://play.spotify.com/track/3LGxef3inmn5jMLGDz9...</a> [/spotify]</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=91 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Brit singer has a penchant for singing about heartbreak―which was especially obvious with her album 25—but after forlorn singles like "Hello" and "When We Were Young," "Send My Love" was a surprising, tongue-in-cheek response to a breakup. Rather than make a tear-inducing ballad, she shows us it's ok to be snarky over an ended relationship, through an acoustic-led melody and her signature belt-y vocals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=93 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>"Pink + White" by Frank Ocean feat.

(One might even count the alternative version of the latter, which were handed at his pop-up shop, as a third.) With all of Ocean's new songs, and none previously released as singles, this track has proven itself to be a favorite, partially because it boasts big names in the credits (Pharrell Williams produced, Beyoncé sang backup), but also because of its raw, relatable nostalgia.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=99 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>"Broccoli (feat.
