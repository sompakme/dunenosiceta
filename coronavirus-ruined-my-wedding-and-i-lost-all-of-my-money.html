"We had sent out save the dates months ago, and everyone had booked a flight out to Tel Aviv."</p><p id=eXsdPZ_TnHEl data-wc=45>Lea and her partner live in Israel, while their families live in London and Paris. Just 15 days before Lea was due to say I do on 23 March, Israel closed the borders from France, meaning that no French citizens were allowed into the country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ce1865d30be3-lea-ruben-london-z-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e8bkqk8smhN4 data-wc=12><strong>Lea and Ruben lost all of the money spent on the wedding</strong></p><p id=eGL45oUI5bUo data-wc=35>"I sobbed," said Lea. "That was more than half of our guest list. I had hoped that it would go on as most of my family live in London, but in time things got worse."</p><p id=ehrf8S-CIowz data-wc=41>Sure enough, Israel went on to enforce a 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving into the country from overseas- London included. Since her family were only arriving a few days before the wedding, they wouldn't be out in time for the ceremony.</p><p id=ekx7X-pqdL8U data-wc=1><strong>SEE: <a class=hm-link href=#>How coronavirus could affect your house sale</a></strong></p><p id=eteTlzviTrRp><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f15cf2b1bfcd-lea-and-ruben-a.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=exvg05T_ltqZ data-wc=10><strong>Lea and Ruben were planning the wedding since January 2019</strong></p><p id=eqbbH_8GpC0Z data-wc=48>"This was the most important part for me," said Lea. "I can't imagine getting married without my parents and siblings." Despite missing the wedding date, her parents have decided to fly out and endure the quarantine in the hope of making this tough time less stressful for Lea.&nbsp;</p><p id=e48HnMvMtLjB data-wc=81>Interestingly, though the country is implementing strict rules upon entry, there is currently no protection for local businesses or residents affected by the coronavirus outbreak. "The venue manager was happy to go ahead with the wedding," Lea told us. "Because it was our choice to cancel, they are not willing to pay us back and we have lost 100 per cent of our fees." She adds that they've also lost the money they shelled out for everything from caterers to flowers.</p><p id=eV6fVASP8xm4 data-wc=27>In the UK, however, the chancellor has unveiled a <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>£350billion package</a> to help the economy, including grants of up to £25,000 for small businesses which could include wedding vendors.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e53c16bd82a6-lea-ruben-two-x-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eqqkiJSW_Pm8 data-wc=13><strong>Lea and Ruben are unable to afford&nbsp;another wedding of the same size</strong></p><p id=ep23P7850caI data-wc=78>"We have decided to hire a lawyer," she added. "This is a situation that doesn't depend on us and it's unfair that we have to pay the price. We wanted and want to get married but we would be paying for 250 guests when over 200 of them are unable to attend because the Israeli government has closed the borders. Even if it isn't the venue's fault, something should be done to protect people who suffer the consequences."</p><p id=et_LXT3uakR3 data-wc=37>As for her guests, Lea says that many have lost the money they spent on flights and hotels for their stay and, to add insult to injury, Lea and Ruben have lost money from their honeymoon, too.</p><p id=ezM81KyjS2PF data-wc=97>"We had a trip booked to the Maldives for the week after our wedding, but now we won't be going since we won't be allowed back into the country without having to go into quarantine. We wouldn't be able to work during this time which isn't an option for us." As a result, the couple have lost half of their hotel fees (this was a standard reimbursement agreement, and not a practice enforced due to coronavirus), but luckily were refunded 100 per cent of their flight fees as the Israeli airline had cancelled all flights to Asia.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=ezSqd5LG0LzX data-wc=10><strong>WATCH: Lorraine Kelly reveals daughter has self-isolated amid coronavirus threat</strong></p><p id=ecvuAvNhejRb data-wc=44>Lea and Ruben are too upset to look into rescheduling at this point, but Lea says that they hope to get some of their money back to use on a smaller wedding since they wouldn't be able to afford another of the same size.</p><p id=eTTppsr4zQzL data-wc=82>Her advice for any couples due to marry soon? "Make sure you have some sort of wedding insurance and protection if you haven't already booked your venue. I also became aware that a lot of people are apprehensive about being in crowds and touching like they would while dancing so, if I'm honest, I would avoid getting married within the next few months." And for any UK-based brides, the recent lockdown announcement means that there might be no choice but to postpone.</p><p id=elYetedv1YQ8 data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
