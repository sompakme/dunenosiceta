Overall, he ended up getting wrapped up in a RICO case just one year into his career. However, he went and snitched on every single person he was associated with. This subsequently led to him receiving a reduced sentence, and by 2020, he had his freedom back. Since that time, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he has dropped a few albums</a>, although many of them have Latin influences.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It has been an exceptionally long time since 6ix9ine <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">gave us one of those screamed records</a> he was most known for. In fact, he has mostly been spending all of his time in the Dominican Republic. Overall, this is where he has picked up his new sound, and has ultimately stayed with it for a few years now. However, that could all change very soon. We say this because according to DJ Akademiks, 6ix9ine is officially back in the United States of America.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-6ix9ine-is-back>6ix9ine Is Back</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">No one truly knows what this means for his career going forward. Of course, this could just be a temporary visit as opposed to a permanent move. However, fans are certainly anticipating what is about to happen next. The last time 6ix9ine was in the U.S., he was antagonizing the likes of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Durk</a> and Blueface. Only time will tell if he begins to troll at the same rate he used to.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think about 6ix9ine returning to the United States, in the comments section down below.
