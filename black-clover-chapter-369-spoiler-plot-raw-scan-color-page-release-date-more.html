The chapter showed the aftermath of the battle between the Dark Triad and the Clover Kingdom’s magic knights, as well as the Spade Kingdom’s resistance. The chapter also showed the opening of the gate to the underworld, which unleashed a horde of devils upon the world.</p><p>The chapter starts with Yami and William, who were captured by the Dark Triad and used as sacrifices to open the gate to the underworld. Yami and William were shown to be unconscious and bleeding, while the Dark Triad members, Dante, Vanica, and Zenon, were celebrating their victory. Dante said that they had fulfilled their mission and that they would soon meet their true master, Lucifer, the king of the devils.</p><p>The chapter then shifted to the Clover Kingdom, where the magic knights were recovering from their injuries and mourning their losses. Asta, who had lost his right arm and his sword, was crying over Yami’s disappearance, while Nacht, the vice-captain of the Black Bulls, was scolding him for his weakness. Nacht said that Asta had failed to protect his captain and that he had no right to call himself a magic knight. Nacht also said that he had a plan to rescue Yami and William and that he would need Asta’s help.</p><p>The chapter then moved to the Spade Kingdom, where the resistance members, led by Ralph and Yuno, were fighting against the Dark Disciples, who were loyal to the Dark Triad. Ralph and Yuno managed to defeat some of the Dark Disciples, but they were soon overwhelmed by their numbers and power. Ralph said that they had to keep fighting, even if it meant sacrificing their lives, while Yuno said that he would never give up, and that he would save his homeland and his captain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Black-Clover-Chapter-369-review.jpg><p>The chapter then showed the gate to the underworld, which was glowing with a sinister light. The gate was shown to have seven levels, each corresponding to a different layer of the underworld. The gate was also shown to have a timer, which indicated how long it would take for each level to open. The first level, which contained the lowest-ranking devils, was already open, and the second level, which contained the mid-ranking devils, was about to open. The chapter also showed that the gate would take seven days to fully open and that once it did, the highest-ranking devils, including Lucifero, would emerge from the underworld.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_to_Read_Black_Clover_Chapter_369></span><strong>Where to Read Black Clover Chapter 369?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The chapter then showed the Clover Kingdom and the Spade Kingdom being invaded by the devils, who were flying in the sky and attacking the people. The devils were shown to be cruel and sadistic, enjoying the chaos and destruction they caused. The chapter also showed some of the magic knights and the resistance members trying to fight back against the devils, but they were easily overpowered and killed by them.</p><p>The chapter then showed Noelle, who was in the Heart Kingdom with Mimosa, Secre, and Patolli. Noelle was shown to be worried about Asta and the others, and she wondered if they were still alive. She also wondered what had happened to Lolopechka, the queen of the Heart Kingdom, who had been possessed by the devil Megicula. Noelle then sensed a powerful magic presence, and she turned around to see Lolopechka standing behind her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGikmqaXlnyjuMCcomabnKTDpr6MnJ%2BaqKSav25%2FlXJm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-you-write-off-alcohol-as-a-business-expense.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Can you write off alcohol as a business expense?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./actress-l%C3%A9a-seydoux-street-style.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Actress La Seydoux Street Style</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
