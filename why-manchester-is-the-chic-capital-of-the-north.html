Once known as the hive of industry, the bee was long ago adopted as a symbol of the city, which rose to prominence in the Victorian era as the centre of cotton production. Its history as ‘Cottonopolis’ is what drew Chanel here: the luxury French brand staged an extraordinary takeover of the Northern Quarter streets, bringing its Métiers d'Art show to life here on 7 December last year, marking the first time Manchester had ever been patronised by a luxury fashion brand.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was a massive coup for the city, which is enjoying something of a renaissance, despite Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s announcement that HS2 would no longer be connecting it to London. Indeed, there’s a feeling in the air that Mancs don’t actually want to leave, with so much going on in their beloved city. “HSWho?” is a common refrain.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for 'Gabrielle Chanel.

The impressive venue, which sits on the corner of the iconic Sunlight House, an art deco masterpiece by architect Joseph Sunlight, is now a go-to for seasoned drinks aficionados.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then, there's Sexy Fish. Opened to much fanfare in Manchester’s nightlife neighbourhood of Spinningfields in September last year, it’s the latest launch from billionaire businessman Richard Caring, whose roster of luxury eateries and members’ clubs includes Annabel’s, The Ivy, Bacchanalia and J. Sheekey. Described as “so bling it’s brilliant” by The Times, there’s a live DJ, Damien Hirst artworks, over-the-top loos (a must for Instagram these days) and a Japanese menu of dishes that spans black cod to Wagyu beef and everything in between.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ex-footballer Gary Neville – born and bred in Manchester – has a burgeoning hospitality empire which includes the city’s most luxurious 5-star hotel, the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/stock-exchange.en-gb.html?aid=2200763&label=manchester-chic-capital-north" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stock Exchange" data-vars-ga-product-id=f536ac74-d472-4731-b0de-beea2fefd38d data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/stock-exchange.en-gb.html?aid=2200763&label=manchester-chic-capital-north" data-product-url="https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/stock-exchange.en-gb.html?aid=2200763&label=manchester-chic-capital-north" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fgb%2Fstock-exchange.en-gb.html%3Faid%3D2200763%26label%3Dmanchester-chic-capital-north" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand="king oscar" data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=bb21b267-f5a9-4042-b33c-14c5af2ce7c9 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="king oscar" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Stock Exchange</a>, the Penthouse of which might be familiar to some as the filming site of Netflix’s recent Beckham documentary.

Featuring 162 rooms, as well as private apartments to rent, there will also be a swish fitness centre and top-of-the-line spa. Opening slightly sooner will be a new Soho House, the first in the North, which is slated to throw open its doors this year. Situated in the storied former Granada Studios building in the trendy St John’s area, it will have a gym and an outdoor swimming pool. It will also be home to Mollie's Motel, a "budget-luxe" offering – designed by Soho House – complete with a bar, diner and 128 bedrooms over five floors.</p><img alt="a table with glasses and plates on it next to a tree with flowers" title="manchester chanel" width=3000 height=1999 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dscf0046-enhanced-nr-6569e2eb9c9e8.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Ex-footballer Gary Neville has made the Stock Exchange Hotel the city's most popular</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Bringing Soho House to other cities in the UK has always been something we've wanted to do and, as a Mancunian, I’m particularly proud to be coming to Manchester,” says Soho House & Co CEO Andrew Carnie. “Nick [Jones] and the design team have worked hard to create a space for our members that preserves the heritage of the Granada Studios building, while introducing a rooftop pool terrace and floor-to-ceiling windows on the top floor. The view of the city is going to be amazing from there and I can’t wait for members to experience it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As if that wasn’t enough for Manchester to shout about, there’s also the Co-op Live indoor arena, arriving in spring of this year, which will be the UK’s biggest, with 23,000 capacity: no wonder stars including Take That, Olivia Rodrigo, Liam Gallagher and Niall Horan have already lined up gigs.</p><img alt="a room with tables and chairs and a large screen" title="a room with tables and chairs and a large screen" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/johnnystephensphotography-15-0e8a2236-edit-6569e3708b571.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Sexy Fish in Manchester is as glam as you'd expect</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Manchester has gone through various identities in the past few decades. It was ‘Madchester’ in the 1990s, home of rave culture, the Happy Mondays and Oasis. In the 2000s, its poster girl and boy were model Agyness Deyn and designer Henry Holland. The 2010s saw the takeover of fast-fashion brands like Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing, the HQs of which are here (mega-influencer, Love Islander and former PLT creative director, Molly Mae Hague, has lived here for over five years). Will the 2020s see its reincarnation as a luxury mecca?
