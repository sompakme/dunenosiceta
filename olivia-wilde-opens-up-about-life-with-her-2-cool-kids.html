They're huge and they're so healthy and happy," she said. "I already feel like they're giant teenagers, but we're having a lot of fun. They're my best friends."</p><p>She added, "We have so much fun. They're so active. They're musicians and they're athletes and they're just cool. They both play drums and they sing and we just have a great time. We're a big karaoke family."</p><p>Wilde shares son Otis Alexander, 9, and daughter Daisy Josephine, 7, with ex Jason Sudeikis. The two actors first started dating in 2011, getting engaged in 2013, though they never ended up tying the knot. In 2020, reports that the two had split up emerged. Sources assured fans that they remained committed to coparenting.</p><p>Sudeikis caused an uproar when he <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/dont-worry-darling-drama-timeline/>served Wilde with custody papers</a> while she was on stage at CinemaCon in Las Vegas in April 2022. Speaking out about this experience in a subsequent interview, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/olivia-wilde-oscars-vanity-fair-2023/>the filmmaker</a> said, "It was my workplace. In any other workplace, it would be seen as an attack. It was really upsetting. It shouldn’t have been able to happen. There was a huge breach in security, which is really scary."</p><p>In court documents, the Ted Lasso star explained how this all came about. "I did not want service to take place at the home of Olivia’s current partner [<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a35797601/harry-styles-olivia-wilde-relationship-timeline/>Harry Styles</a>, whom Wilde dated <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/olivia-wilde-harry-styles-break-up/>between 2021 and 2022</a>] because Otis and Daisy might be present. I did not want service to take place at the children’s school because parents might be present," he stated.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
