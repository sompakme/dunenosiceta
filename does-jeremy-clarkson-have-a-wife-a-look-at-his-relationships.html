However, he has been married twice and is currently in a romantic relationship. Below is Jeremy Clarkson's relationship history since he came into the limelight.</p><h3>Alexandra Hall (1989—1990)</h3><p class=align-left>The former <i>Top Gear</i> host was married to Alexandra James. The two met when Alex was 17 years old and Clarkson 22 years old. They tied the knot in 1989; the <a href=#>wedding</a> was held at St. Andrew's church in South Warnborough, Hampshire, UK. They went on their honeymoon in Mauritius.</p><p class=align-left>Their marriage did not last long, as they divorced after six months. It is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported that</a> Alex left him for his best friend, Stephen Hall, whom they married in 1993. The couple share two children.</p><h3>Frances Catherine Cain (1993–2014)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2b7fa8852bc68373.png><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>British journalist</a> also married Frances Cain after his first marriage failed. They tied the knot in 1993. They sired three children: Emily, Finlo and Katya Clarkson. Emily was born on 21 July 1994, Finlo on 14 March 1997, and Katya on 24 November 2000.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/eb5f9b80272a86b0.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does Greg Davies have a wife?

Their marriage lasted for over two decades, and they divorced in 2011. They allegedly parted ways due to Jeremy's unfaithfulness.</p><p class=align-left>It was around 2010 when his first wife, Alex, planned to write a book about their relationship. She wanted to disclose their secret love affair of almost ten years. However, Jeremy lifted a gigging order to prevent her from revealing their relationship.

I can prove we had an affair. The truth will be out. We did have an affair.<p class=align-left>Alex disclosed that they rekindled their love in 1999. In spite of all that, there were more speculations that Jeremy had an affair with Phillipa Sage, which is believed to have been the main reason the couple had a divorce.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/68b1615a99e7ec0f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who are Jeremy Clarkson’s children?
