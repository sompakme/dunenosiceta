However, most drivers were more concerned with its road manners, versatility and reassuringly conventional looks. Today, only a handful are believed to be roadworthy.&nbsp;</p><p>When Vauxhall’s sister GM brand Opel unveiled the Corsa supermini at the 1982 Paris motor show, plans for a Vauxhall derivative faced considerable opposition. The Nova (the UK-market version didn’t take the Corsa badge until the next generation) was to be built in Spain’s Zaragoza plant, at a time of great anger about “captive imports”. British Leyland had recently launched the Honda-designed <a href=#>Triumph Acclaim</a>, while Ford GB annually distributed 60,000 Spanish-built Fiestas. Meanwhile, almost half of Vauxhall Cavaliers and 55% of Astras hailed from overseas factories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The launch of the Nova took place in controversial circumstances on 27 April 1983</span></figure><p>October of 1982 saw the threat of strikes if Vauxhall imported the Nova, but the launch finally took place on 27 April 1983. Prices varied from £3,496 to £4,273, with 1.0-litre OHV, 1.2-litre OHC or 1.3-litre OHC engine choices. The company hoped an up-to-date supermini would consolidate its sales growth; by 1982, in its challenge to Ford’s dominance Vauxhall held more than 11% of the new car market compared with little more than 7% in the previous year.&nbsp;</p><p>Vauxhall naturally planned an elaborate sales campaign for its first front-wheel drive supermini, including <a href=#>a Simon Cadell-voiced television commercial</a>. The “Little Better Car” had to tempt owners of the Vauxhall’s own rear-drive Chevette (which would cease production in 1984) and drivers of other small hatchbacks. The company informed its dealers that the <a href=#>Austin Metro</a> had a “surprisingly indifferent” reputation and the <a href=#>Ford Fiesta</a> was “a mid-seventies car”. As for the Volkswagen Polo, that was apparently “at a price disadvantage”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The interior of the Nova, production of which ended in 1993 after nearly 500,000 units were made</span></figure><p>Fortunately, this newspaper stated: “Vauxhall, I am sure, has another winner with its new Nova.” Autocar was equally impressed: “General Motors have every reason to feel hopeful about the future.” The Nova became a regular in the top 10 best-sellers lists, behind the Fiesta and Metro. Moreover, unlike its BL and Ford rivals, the Nova was available in a two-door guise, without the de rigeur hatchback tailgate. The saloon version’s popularity somewhat surprised Vauxhall, but it held a particular appeal to the type of motorists who regarded Des O’Connor records as cutting edge.&nbsp;</p><p>A four-door saloon and five-door hatchback joined the range in 1985, with a facelift for the range in 1990. Production ended in 1993 after nearly 500,000 units, in favour of the curvier Corsa B hatchback. A&nbsp; few years later, they gained a not entirely fair reputation as archetypal “chav transport”, often manifested as a bottom-of-the-range Merit adorned with stripes and a loud aftermarket exhaust system. Neither enhanced the overall performance, but they helped the owner to cut a dash at their local drive-in eatery.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>With the Nova, Vauxhall hoped an up-to-date supermini would consolidate its sales growth</span></figure><p>However,&nbsp; Mark Ridley of <a href=#>Novasportregister.com</a> is keen to change perspectives of the brand. He is the proud owner of a white 1984 convertible and explains: “Irmscher did the conversion, which was factory-recognised. The cars were shipped from Spain direct to the coachbuilder in Germany. My Nova is the first UK model and the press car from the 1984 Motor Show.” Ridley also remarks that it drives “like a 1984 car”, but that is part of the enjoyment.&nbsp;</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, Andrew Oag’s 1985-model 1.2L is far more representative of the brand. Nova publicity inevitably emphasised the flagship SR with its spoilers and exuberant tartan upholstery, but Oag’s car would have been a far more common sight. Furthermore, Vauxhall urged its sales teams to inform prospective buyers that, unlike the rival low-spec Fiesta L, the Nova featured halogen headlights and even a “colour-keyed” load compartment cover.&nbsp;</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Mark Ridley's 1984 Nova convertible</span></figure><p>When the first Novas appeared in the showrooms, many within Vauxhall feared it marked an irrevocable step for the company. There were genuine concerns that the marque would become an assembler and distributor of Opel designs solely for the UK market. But, in reality, parent company General Motors had set these changes in motion in the early 1970s, and the Nova was the right model launched at the right time.&nbsp;</p><p>And who could resist the lure of “Piper Tweed” cloth upholstery, which reinforced “the impression of overall refinement”?</p><p>Thanks to: Andrew Oag and Mark Ridley</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJuRp8Bwr8uaqqyhk2TBqbGMr5iusJiWua15zaitmmWRqXp1fI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-the-crankshaft-position-sensor-located-on-a-2008-dodge-caliber.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where is the crankshaft position sensor located on a 2008 Dodge Caliber?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-2023-nail-trends-that-are-taking-over-according-to-the-pros.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 2023 Nail Trends That Are Taking Over, According to the Pros</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
