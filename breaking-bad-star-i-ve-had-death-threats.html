But as a human being, I'm concerned that so many people react to Skyler with such venom."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Gunn revealed that the Facebook group 'I Hate Skyler White' had received thousands of likes from fans of the show, and another featured a group name so offensive she was unable to repeat it in her article.</p><p>It appears that many fans saw the character's initial reluctance to accept husband Walter's new-found life of crime as a highly annoying aspect of the show's narrative.</p><p>Gunn explained that fans found her character to be a "shrieking, hypocritical harpy" and that she didn't "deserve the great life that she has".</p><p>However, the hatred became so much for the actress that she was even forced to review her security after receiving a death threat from one fan.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>She revealed: 'One such post read: "Could somebody tell me where I can find Anna Gunn so I can kill her?" Besides being frightened (and taking steps to ensure my safety), I was also astonished: how had disliking a character spiraled into homicidal rage at the actress playing her?'</p><p>Reasoning why fans have reacted in such a way, the actress wrote: "Because Skyler didn't conform to a comfortable ideal of the archetypical female, she had become a kind of Rorschach test for society, a measure of our attitudes toward gender."</p><p>It's not the first time that Gunn has spoken about the fan backlash over her character.</p><p>In May, she told <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>: "People in Albuquerque are crazy about Breaking Bad, and the thing that I didn't expect was how much people got into the characters, and this incredible backlash against Skyler.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p>"I wasn't really aware it was happening until people started telling me, 'Your character is a b****. Did you know that?' And I was like, 'I do now!'"</p><p><i>Breaking Bad</i> is in its last season and just six episodes remain.
