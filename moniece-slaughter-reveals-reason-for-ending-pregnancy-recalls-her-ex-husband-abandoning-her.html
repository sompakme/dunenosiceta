I appreciate you. You saw the medical papers and the ultrasounds and you were there for me on the day of my DNC. I'm grateful. I am tired. To say that you can't believe that I was married to my husband because you think I lied about a pregnancy, a pregnancy that I bled out three times for, was hospitalized for, fought tooth and nail to keep. I had my thumbs tied on the table on the day of my DNC," she said. "I will never experience motherhood again the natural way and that's fine. But I had to do it. I had to do it on a heart condition. And I chose the best route for me which was I chose to terminate at 29 weeks-- almost full term. If anybody wants to know, let's just put it to rest. Let's just put it to bed. Let's just move on."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-moniece-slaughter-attends-paige-hurd-s-birthday-party>Moniece Slaughter Attends Paige Hurd's Birthday Party</h2></span><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - JULY 16: Singer / Reality TV Personality Moniece Slaughter attends the enchanted 30th Birthday celebration of Paige Hurd at Harbor House on July 16, 2022 in Los Angeles, California.

I was in the dentist for prenatal gingivitis. My teeth were cracking at the crown... I was cracking teeth. You want to know what happened to my show? I wasn't willing to film losing my child, that I didn't have a stillborn, I didn't miscarry, I chose, I made a decision for my ex-husband, the man that described me as the woman of his dreams, introduced me to his children, spent time around my son, answered my phone when I was down after my surgery, was in a group chat with me and my family to denounce our marriage and marriages that I hold sacred."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-moniece-slaughter-reflects-on-her-pregnancy>Moniece Slaughter Reflects On Her Pregnancy</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It's not the first time <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the&nbsp;Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood&nbsp;star</a> has broken down in an emotional video about the topic.
