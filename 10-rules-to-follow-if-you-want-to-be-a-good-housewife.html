Women are expected to be loaded with certain supernatural powers that could hold marriages down and make them work no matter what.</strong></p><p>In view of these, it is totally up to women to make marriages work against all odds. While they are working on shells in ensuring their relationships do not break, they also have to be conscious of the way they sell themselves to people.</p><p>The impression they give people is one of the things that make them get worked up. Most wives in Nigeria are responsible women; most times, women getting married are usually groomed in preparation of the new life and phase they would be starting.</p><p>Despite all these, there are certain rules and regulations a woman is expected to adhere to if she wants to be referred to as a good housewife in Nigeria.
