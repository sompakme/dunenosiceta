Women are expected to be loaded with certain supernatural powers that could hold marriages down and make them work no matter what.</strong></p><p>In view of these, it is totally up to women to make marriages work against all odds. While they are working on shells in ensuring their relationships do not break, they also have to be conscious of the way they sell themselves to people.</p><p>The impression they give people is one of the things that make them get worked up. Most wives in Nigeria are responsible women; most times, women getting married are usually groomed in preparation of the new life and phase they would be starting.</p><p>Despite all these, there are certain rules and regulations a woman is expected to adhere to if she wants to be referred to as a good housewife in Nigeria. If you are able to maintain these rules as a woman, you would not only be termed a good housewife, you would also enjoy the union for as long as possible.</p><p>Find below some of the rules you have to stick to if you are a good housewife or you aspire to be one:</p><p class=h3>1. Never question his authority</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5k9bf39rao6.jpg><p>Allow him speak whenever he wants and do not ask him questions. Remember you are his helper not his mother so avoid asking him question.

He would end up being irritated and would end up fighting you.</p><p>READ ALSO:&nbsp;Names of Nigerian guys that are most likely to break your heart</p><p class=h3>2.

Cheating is one of these things. You have to be faithful no matter what; but when he cheats, you have to be ready to forgive him almost immediately. Remember he is the man and you are the woman. Lol.</p><p class=h3>8. Lose the belly fat the moment you deliver the baby</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1i6539rrtnd.jpg><p>Another rule you have to stick to in order to be referred to as a good housewife is when you stay in shape forever.
