My appearances, I had two, three appearances scheduled weekly, then bi-weekly, then monthly, then they kind of disappeared, they were canceled in the last day right before I was supposed to go on. So, I was really ticked off.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When prompted by The View co-host Joy Behar, Rivera did proceed to confirm that he was referring to a male castmember on The Five and not Jeanine Pirro, adding, “I love Jeanine.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Fox News afternoon panel show featured a rotating cast of co-hosts from across Fox’s lineup, including Pirro, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. Rivera would make appearances in the rotation as a liberal co-host.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But in the end, he said, “Everything came to everything. Now I’m not mad at anybody. Now I’m a free person.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Earlier during his conversation on The View, Rivera also detailed how he ultimately ended up at his decision to leave the network as a whole.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I got a call from two of the female executives and they said, ‘You’re off The Five, but there are plenty of other things you can do.'” he recalled. “I had a year and a half left on my contract. And I said, ‘Well, stuff it, if you fired me from the No. 1 show, then I’m going to quit.’ And that’s basically what happened.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He continued, “In the interim, in the days that led up to my last day of work, they were so kind to me… They were so nice, remembering all the things we did together over the 20-odd years.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When asked why they didn’t just build him another show, Rivera added, “They could have, I guess,” but that he feels like his “ideology does not fit Fox” anymore.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Rivera previously told <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://apnews.com/article/fox-geraldo-rivera-five-gutfeld-6e0c60a67deedb1736a61592a8229046>the Associated Press</a> that there was friction in front of and behind the cameras on the Fox News panel show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“There has been a growing tension that goes beyond editorial differences and personal annoyances and gripes,” he told the outlet in June. “It’s not worth it to me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Fox News for comment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOoJyrmZyZvG6%2ByK%2Bcq5ldp7K3scClqmasn622pHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkraCVYrOqwsRmmqhlo6mus3mQa2pubWNrf3GAjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-have-merry-maids-clean-your-house.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How much does it cost to have Merry Maids clean your house?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./family-friends-parks-playgrounds-on-hilton-head-island.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Family Friends Parks &amp;amp; Playgrounds on Hilton Head Island</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
