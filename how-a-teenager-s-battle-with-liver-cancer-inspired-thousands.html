His death has left a deep void in the hearts of his family, friends, schoolmates, and community, who remember him as a bright, kind, and brave young man.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>AJ Fetty’s Journey: From Mono to Cancer</strong></h2><p>Fetty’s ordeal began in September 2023, when he went to the hospital with symptoms of mononucleosis, a common viral infection that causes fever, sore throat, and fatigue. However, further tests revealed that he had multiple tumors in his liver, which were later diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer.</p><p>HCC is a rare disease in children and adolescents, accounting for less than 1% of all pediatric cancers. The causes of HCC in young patients are not well understood, but some risk factors include chronic liver diseases, genetic disorders, and exposure to toxins. The prognosis of HCC depends on the stage of the disease, the size and number of tumors, the liver function, and the response to treatment.</p><p>AJ’s condition was very serious, as he had advanced tumors that caused severe complications, such as bleeding, aneurysm, and infection. He was transferred to the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, where he received intensive care and underwent several procedures to stabilize his condition and manage his symptoms. He also celebrated his 16th birthday at the hospital on October 10, surrounded by his loved ones.</p><p><a href=#>AJ Fetty</a>’s doctors hoped to start him on cancer medication once his liver had healed enough from the previous interventions. They also considered the possibility of a liver transplant if the tumors shrank enough to make him eligible for surgery. However, AJ’s condition deteriorated rapidly in the last week of October, when more tumors eroded his blood vessels and caused massive bleeding. He received blood transfusions and another procedure to patch the bleed, but his body could not cope with the stress. He passed away peacefully on October 30, with his family by his side.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:- <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Who was Maximus Knight?

He had dreams of becoming a computer engineer and traveling the world.</p><p>His story has also inspired many people across the country and beyond, who have learned about his plight through social media and news outlets.

His family has set up a GoFundMe page to help with the medical expenses and funeral arrangements. The page has raised over $18,000 as of October 31, surpassing the original goal of $10,000. The page also serves as a tribute to AJ’s life and a platform for people to share their condolences and stories about him.</p><p><strong>Related:- <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Karla Lissette Vargas Died, Obituary</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Reminder to Live Fully and Gratefully</strong></h2><p>Fetty’s life was cut short by a rare and cruel disease that robbed him of his future. However, he did not let his illness define him or diminish his spirit. He fought bravely until the end and showed remarkable grace and gratitude for every moment he had. He taught us all a valuable lesson: to live fully and gratefully.</p><p>In one of his last posts on Facebook, AJ wrote:</p><p>I just want everyone to know that I love you all so much. You guys are amazing people and I’m so glad I got to meet you all. You guys have made my life so much better and I can’t thank you enough for that. You guys are my family and I will never forget you.</p><p>AJ’s message is a reminder to cherish our loved ones, appreciate our blessings, and make the most of our time on this earth. He may be gone physically, but he will always be with us in spirit. Rest in peace, AJ Fetty. You will be missed dearly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGimm6Gkqq6zxY6aoWaelanBunnDnpitoF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-many-hours-does-it-take-to-fly-from-san-francisco-to-sydney-australia.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Many Hours Does It Take To Fly From San Francisco To Sydney Australia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eric-cowell-is-dad-simon-s-twin-in-rare-new-photo-shared-by-amanda-holden.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eric Cowell is dad Simon's twin in rare new photo shared by Amanda Holden</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
