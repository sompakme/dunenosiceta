After being in the industry for so long, both modeling and acting, she says that she's ready to embrace her "Fuck It Era" and celebrated that new mindset with one of&nbsp;Glamour's Woman of the Year Awards. Shields spoke to the publication about how she's no longer concerned about looking youthful all the time and is choosing to focus her energy on feeling great and living her life to the fullest, instead.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I love food, and I love alcohol, and I love life, and I want to be healthy for my heart,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Glamour</a>. “I don’t like going to the gym. And I am tired of not feeling skinny enough. It’s boring and it’s a waste of my time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shields added that it took her a long time to be able to approach life through this new lens and she shared that she wishes that she'd been able to stop caring a long time ago, calling the whole thing "a process."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I don’t think I could have gotten here earlier," she said. "You really have to tread through it. I wish I could say it was a lot earlier than recently.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Raymond Hall/GC Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The star noted that she had felt similarly before, pointing out that after she had her two daughters, Rowan and Grier, she was in a similar headspace and focused more on being healthy than on what she looked like.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My body had a purpose that nobody [could take away],” she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, she says that she is extremely happy to be able to share the new outlook with her daughters and women everywhere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m at this place which I don’t think I dreamt I’d ever get to. I’m changing the narrative that I’ve been playing over in my head: not good enough, too famous, not this, not this, not this. I am so proud," she said. "I’m proud of my girls: two vibrant women who are going to be fine, who are unique and smart and funny and different. I feel lucky, and I do feel proud because I know I had something to do with it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nobody is perfect, however, and even Shields admits to moments of insecurity. She is quick to shift the negativity, however, saying that all the time spent critiquing herself can be used in more productive ways.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I wish stuff was a little higher, and I have a bit of a belly that I never had,” she added. “I could lose it if I really, really wanted to try, but I would rather spend that time having lunch, reading a book, walking, buying a piece of jewelry, going to my daughter’s games.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In another moment of vulnerability, Shields said that she was going too far with procedures and that she was losing herself in the hunt for eternal youth. While she's not against certain treatments, she's learned from her mistakes and won't go overboard ever again. Whatever she does, though, she says she'll always make sure that she manages to continue looking like herself.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think it’s easy to go down the slope of overdoing it. I’m scared of not looking like myself; the times that I’ve had Botox, I end up with this Spock eye and I’m like, 'I don’t look like myself,'" she shared. “But I’ll get [the laser peel] Fraxels, and peels, and whatever the newest thing is, and I’ll try it. I just don’t want to not look like myself."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57waumqKOVYsCptcSlm6xlkqS%2FqrrGZquoZZOdrrSxjLKmrqyYYrStrcyorKtlkayus7CMcWpxbWhqfw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bryan-andrews-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bryan Andrews Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blueface-s-mom-speaks-on-child-protective-services-investigation.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blueface's Mom Speaks On Child Protective Services Investigation</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
