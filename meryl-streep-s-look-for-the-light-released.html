The single, which is currently available on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Spotify</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Apple Music</a>, is among a season three soundtrack that features new <a href=# id=auto-tag_music_1 data-tag=music>music</a> from a number of notable Broadway names, including Marc Shaiman, Scott Wittman and Michael R.

But she also championed Streep, noting that it “truly felt like a dream” to write for the actress.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Meryl was gentle and focused, and I loved her musicality and her willingness to share her process,” Bareilles added. “Ashley Park’s glorious counter melody was added later, and I got goosebumps the first time I heard it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Pasek and Paul also called Bareilles a dream collaborator, as they crafted the “song for the legendary Meryl Streep” alongside her. “Getting to shape this song around Meryl’s voice, and working together in the studio and on set, was a dream and we are three very lucky songwriters. Meryl not only amazed us with her usual brilliance and mastery of the craft, but also inspired us with her humility and tireless work ethic. While it is unfair for someone to be so wonderful at everything, it’s a basic human truth that we all must reckon with!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Season three’s musical inspirations are driven by Charles (Steve Martin), Oliver (Martin Short) and Mabel’s (Selena Gomez) latest investigation, which takes them behind the scenes of a Broadway murder. Paul Rudd’s Ben Glenroy is a Hollywood action star set to make his Broadway debut before he meets an untimely death. Streep’s Loretta Durkin, Glenroy’s co-star, aids the trio as they embark on the case amid Oliver’s attempts to save his show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While music plays a particularly prominent role in season three of the Emmy-winning series, previous seasons have also featured original music, including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Martin’s “Angel in Flip-Flops.”</a> Performed as Martin’s character from his Brazzos days, the single — which also got a colorful and trippy music video — was produced by Paul Shaffer and co-written by Martin and Only Murders executive producer Kirker Butler.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOqKWlsV2iwrOwxKuqZqGeYsGpsYybrKKklJ67qHnMnqmypF2owbOxxKlkpaefoHqnu9Fmq6GdXaG2qLTTZqmepJWWwKawjGppbG1la4R0f49o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mindless-behavior-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mindless Behavior Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./khamzat-chimaev-biography-family-background-career-net-worth-social-media-and-more-about-the-uf.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Khamzat Chimaev: Biography, Family Background, Career, Net Worth, Social Media And More About The UF</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
