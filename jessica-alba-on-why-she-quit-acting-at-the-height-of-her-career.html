The actress and entrepreneur attributes her change in career to the switch of mindset she had following the birth of her daughter Honor in 2008.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My mother had cancer at a really young age, in her early 20s. I grew up with chronic illness. I had five surgeries before I was 11 years old. I had chronic allergies, and I was hospitalized a lot as a child," she said in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Romper</a><strong>.</strong> "I had this real moment of, I want to live, and thrive, and spend as much time with this little person that I'm bringing into the world as possible and stay. So, my health matters. I want this little person to be healthy. And it's really freaking hard to be happy when you don't have your health."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She shared that it was never out of fear or insecurity that she wouldn't receive more acting jobs. "Frankly, I was at the top of my career," said Alba. "I couldn't go back to what I was doing before and be authentic. I just couldn't. I didn't care about it the same way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She has since had two more kids, daughter Haven, 9, and son Hayes, 3, and said becoming a mother made her strive to do "something bigger."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I felt like if I was going to have this platform, then what can I do with it that could be meaningful and make a difference?" she said. "That just felt so real when I became a mom for the first time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2012, Alba launched <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Honest Company</a>, which specializes in natural baby, cleaning, and beauty products. And while the company has since taken off (selling with retail giants like Target), it wasn't always so easy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Building a brand and building a business is f—king impossible," she said. "And to be good at it and for it to thrive and scale, it is really hard. If anything, I was like, 'Do I really want to do this?' In every stage, I'm trying to get better and better as a business person, but it's a totally different skill set than just taking your influence and fame and putting your name on a package and doing a press tour, picking out a couple designs."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She has since dabbled in other acting gigs, including the short-lived series L.A.'s Finest — a spinoff of the Bad Boys franchise — alongside <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gabrielle Union</a>. But Alba is a woman of many talents and we're just excited to see what she takes on next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8meqqyhk5Z6orjBmmajnaOotqStjJqjm5ldpsKqwIyamq2hnpx6osCMraapZZOWv6ax0Q%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joseph-gordon-levitt-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joseph Gordon-Levitt Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-coke-good-for-menstruation.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Coke good for menstruation?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
