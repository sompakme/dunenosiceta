Most recently, Rodriguez lauded his upcoming thriller <a href=#>Hypnotic</a> as a “Hitchcock thriller on steroids.” Ben Affleck has been cast to play a detective in the thriller. His character has been caught in the tangles of a secret government program while searching for his missing daughter.</p><p><a href=#>Rodriguez</a> has been vocal about his excitement when it comes to working on the film with Ben Affleck. The story will also use the talents of writer Max Borenstein (Godzilla vs. Kong) to work on the production. Hypnotic was<a href=#> hit by COVID-19 delays</a> and will resume the production process in six weeks.</p><p>There’s much pride take in the quality of the film. Rodriguez is especially ecstatic to share the film’s trailer with the world, once it’s completed filming. He praises his work for being exciting and energetic, claiming it as one of his favorite stories that he’s written. Rodriguez began writing Hypnotic back in 2002 which makes this particular film one of the longest pieces of his work that he’s been wanting to create. The Ben Affleck starrer is independently produced and relies on insurances policies, unlike tentpole industry names such as Warner Bros. or Disney.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ben-affleck-smirk-brighter-900x510.jpg><p>Hypnotic has secured Ben Affleck as its lead, who has been stirring up plenty of excitement around his return to DC Films and Warner Bros. It was announced that Affleck would don the cowl one more time as he plans to star in The Flash as Bruce “Batman” Wayne. The extent of how involved his version of Batman will be is unknown yet as he will coincide with DC alumn <a href=#>Michael Keaton,</a> who will take up the same role from a different era. Ben Affleck was originally intended to helm <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="The Batman" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>The Batman</a> in 2022, though the role was turned over to Robert Pattison after Affleck decided against continuing on as the Dark Knight. The Flash is expected to <a href=#>mark the end</a> of Affleck’s time as Batman.</p><p>Ben Affleck was announced as the lead for the Robert Rodriguez film, Hypnotic, in 2019 and the plot has been kept under wraps since news around development first broke. Affleck will share the screen with Alice Braga, and it’s said that the film will unravel conspiracies and high-end crime as the plot unfolds even more. The casting process has still been in motion as the production prepares to start up again and Rodriguez anticipates moving forward with filmmaking. The writer-directed admitted that it was a challenge to start casting due to the heightening of the delta variant. The delta variant has emerged as a global concern as the COVID-19 virus poses an even bigger public health threat due to its enigmatic nature.</p><p>There has been no official release date assigned to Ben Affleck’s Hypnotic yet as it is still waiting to piece key elements together. A 2022 release date may not remain to be in the cards, but the uncertainty of when Rodriguez’s thriller will arrive on the big screen hasn’t deterred him as he’s refusing to slow down. No matter when it hits theaters, it’s sure to have high expectations coming along with it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ialaN6orLFpZyco12nvKW%2ByKCsnrJencGuuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dark-secrets-of-the-cast-of-the-brady-bunch.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dark Secrets Of The Cast Of The Brady Bunch</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-rules-to-follow-if-you-want-to-be-a-good-housewife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 rules to follow if you want to be a good housewife</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
