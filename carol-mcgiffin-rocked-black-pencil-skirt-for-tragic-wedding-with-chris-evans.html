After threatening to break up with the radio DJ, she accepted his proposal and they set the date for 17 September, which Chris deliberately chose in order to combine their wedding reception with the launch party for his new show, TV Mayhem.</p><p id=elr6zrvCTc8 data-wc=52>Carol and Chris tied the knot in Camden with the bride stepping out in a black pencil skirt – a departure from the classic bridal white gown most choose on their big day. "It was quite possibly the most comically tragic moment of my entire life," Carol wrote in the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a>.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: 9 of the most stunning celebrity weddings</figure><p id=eUDKfQNPZuZ data-wc=35>In a rare comment about her former marriage, Carol told her Loose Women co-stars: "Anyone who thinks I married him for his money, that’s nonsense because I had more money than him at the time.</p><p id=eF2ub_AeJcZ data-wc=14><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>5 Loose Women stars' heartbreaking marriage splits: Denise Welch, Jane Moore and more</a></strong></p><p id=esST0HR91ol data-wc=26>"He was nothing without me, nothing.

"After that we became embroiled in a relationship of sorts. I was 30, he was 24. We did almost everything together and laughed so much."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/c485bc179c83-carol-mcgiffin-blue-suit-loose-women.jpg><p id=eIxN-IYjxQO data-wc=62>Carol later explained on Loose Women that part of her attraction to Chris was his ambition.

They agreed to divorce in 1997, with Chris announcing the news hours later at the Comedy Awards, and it was finalised the following year.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Who is Carol McGiffin married to?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2aa2bde426f9-carol-mcgiffin-husband-mark.jpg><p id=eYqZpOS3rxOI data-wc=56>Following the couple's divorce, Chris was married to Billie Piper for six years before tying the knot with <a class=hm-link href=#>Natasha Shishmanian</a>.
