I expressed whenever it was too painful to feed Albie myself and bought so much cream it was unbelievable.

Laura admitted that she is "no blogger" but wanted to shine a light on some of the products she's been using. The Olympic champion revealed that she has been using hand-me-downs, including the pram that she had as a little girl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/118ac208dcd7-laura-kenny-instagram-of-baby-products-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ed-vLwcPI_-d data-wc=10><strong>Laura has been sharing her top tips with other parents</strong></p><p id=eixBRUnF-956 data-wc=60>"We looked at so many prams before Albie was here but we decided to take my parents offer of having mine and my sister's old pram from when we were babies!

Alongside a photo of Jason carrying their son, she wrote: "The last for this post is another carrier which we've started using since Albie is absolutely huge.
