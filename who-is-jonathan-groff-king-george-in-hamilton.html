He's a tremendous singer and a versatile actor; I happen to love how unabashedly evil he can be in his roles, but he plays straitlaced and sweet well, too. He stays away from social media and is private about his personal life, but he's garnered fans around the world for his Broadway roles and, more recently, his TV and movie work as well. So what do we know about him?</p><h2 id=jonathan-groff-got-his-start-in-the-theater-3>Jonathan Groff got his start in the theater.</h2><p>He's actually from Lancaster, PA, and is half Mennonite. He got his big start in the now-iconic&nbsp;Spring Awakening.

IRL, Groff apparently has a wonderful relationship with Miranda and the rest of the cast, and has said he loves how the role brings in the idea of the Revolutionary War feeling like a breakup:</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
