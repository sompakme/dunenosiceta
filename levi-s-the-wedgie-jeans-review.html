These are 100 percent cotton, so there's no give when you first pull them on—something I'm definitely not used to. They're snug through the thighs and butt, and almost a little too tight at the waist (you don't want to wear these to Thanksgiving dinner). I thought I would have to order the next size up, but throughout the day they stretched out a bit and definitely became more comfortable."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The verdict: Did they flatter your butt?</strong> "Yes.

I was concerned because I could tell they were designed to mimic the classic Levi's jean, which I've tried on before in so many different varieties and was never able to find one right for me, so I just gave up. These, however, fit totally fine. I noticed immediately that they have less stretch than what I am typically used to."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The verdict: Did they flatter your butt?</strong> "I wasn't sure when I first looked in the mirror. I feel that from the side, they actually kind of flattened it, which I was not altogether opposed to. From the back, I thought there was weird bunching on my thighs that I didn't like. But once I saw a photo of my butt in the jeans, I was pleasantly surprised. So now of course I'm questioning if in fact any of my own jeans actually make my butt look good without photographic proof."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Kelsey Glein, Associate Editor</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sarah Balch for InStyle.com</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Describe your butt</strong>: "Fairly non-existent.

I love that silhouette in suiting and skirts, but denim transports me back to the '90s when I wore them awkwardly in middle school and had no idea what I was doing. But I was surprised how much I liked them. In addition to the magic they worked from behind, they made my legs look longer and defined my waist. And you get instant cool girl points just by wearing them. In fact, one of the compliments I got was that I looked, 'very Brooklyn.' As for sizing, they do run a little small, so consider sizing up!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The verdict: Did they flatter your butt?</strong> "You mean, did they make me love my butt even more? I think they did a good job of flattering, sure. With skinny jeans, the pockets tend to be lower, which can make you look droopy back there. These have high pockets that curve slightly to follow the natural badonk of your booty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Another key element: </strong>The seaming helps emphasize your curves. They sort of pull up in between your legs—hence the 'Wedgie'—but not uncomfortably. That gives your butt a sort of extra definition."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeVmba1u9Fmq56rpJqxbrjEr6CsZaeasai1xGahnpmeqHqzsdWinLA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pauley-perrette-s-childhood-pictures-are-worlds-away-from-her-look-today.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pauley Perrette's childhood pictures are worlds away from her look today</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./larry-summers-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Larry Summers Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
