Romney, of course, lost to Obama (with a finally tally of 332 electoral votes compared to 206 to Romney). On Wednesday, Morris defended his prediction to Morgan.</p><p>“I absolutely believed it, and so did a lot of people,” he said. “Rasmussen and Gallup both predicted a Romney victory. CNN had a 47-47 tie race in its final poll 48 hours before the polls opened.”</p><p>As for why he was let go, Morris replied, “Because I was wrong, and I was wrong at the top of my lungs.” He added, “Maybe I’m being made a poster child for that.”</p><p>He added that he had a “wonderful talk” with Fox News chairman <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_roger-ailes data-tag=roger-ailes>Roger Ailes</a></strong> about a week ago.</p><p>“He said in this business, you’re up, you’re down, nothing is final or fatal,” Morris said, adding that he doesn’t hold any resentment.</p><p>“Fox has given me the opportunity of a lifetime,” he said. “Fifteen years, 3,000 interviews. And at some point a great marriage has to come to an end. … The divorce isn’t final, but I am seeing other people.”</p><p>As for why Ailes chose to drop Morris but keep <strong>Karl Rove </strong>— who allegedly riled insiders when he challenged the network’s own decision desk’s early “call” that Ohio went for Obama during the election — Morris said he didn’t know why he had been “singled out,” in Morgan’s words.</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: THR’s 35 Most Powerful People in Media</a></strong></p><p>He added that he hasn’t made many mistakes, pointing to his prediction of <strong>Bill Clinton’s</strong> re-election in 1996 as well as <strong>George W. Bush’s</strong> wins in 2000 and 2004.</p><p>“I have gotten 30 senators and governors elected, 14 presidents and prime ministers,” he boasted. “The president of the United States twice. And — one and a half, I worked with others in the first go around. So I’m OK on that score.”</p><p>Morris later turned to the topic of why Romney lost the election, blaming it on Hurricane Sandy. He said that before the storm hit the East Coast in late October, Obama was trailing his Republican rival.</p><p>“Fifteen percent of the voters made up their minds in the last 72 hours, and they cited Sandy as No. 1,” Morris said.</p><p><a href=# id=auto-tag_piers-morgan-tonight data-tag=piers-morgan-tonight>Piers Morgan Tonight</a> airs weeknights at 9 p.m. and 12 a.m. ET on CNN.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOnaCco12ivLO%2ByKxkn6eoYrumw9JmoGZsYW5%2BcoWO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./people-didn-t-get-it-jeff-bridges-says.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;People Didn't Get It,&amp;quot; Jeff Bridges Says</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./while-in-character-filming-never-been-kissed-drew-barrymore-was-told-to-tone-it-down-because.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>While In Character Filming Never Been Kissed, Drew Barrymore Was Told to Tone It Down Because</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
