The former <a class=hm-link href=#>Spice Girl</a> has them dotted around her house, she always travels with them, she added a few symbolic stones to her fall collection last year, and she even has teabags with crystal energy. Confused? So are we.&nbsp;</p><p id=eR-oXLn26H1O data-wc=59>We spoke to Amiee Carlton, the founder of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Liferocks</a>, and Victoria herself is a big fan - she carries around the brand's copper bottles daily. We wanted to know what all the fuss is regarding crystals, how to incorporate crystals into your daily life, and what Amiee recommends for particular life events such as a wedding or a pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/44957a79d79e-victoria-beckham-z.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>So many celebrities are into crystals right now? Why do you think there's such a craze at the moment?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eoHpHwc_Vn_k data-wc=63>I am seeing a massive shift in people look to other modalities for balance and healing. I think that people are just connecting more to the roots of what we come from. At the end of the day, we come from the universe. Crystals come from the universe. Why would we not feel connected to them? It just history and human behaviour, right?&nbsp;</p><p id=eyhE54LvPVwM data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>David and Victoria Beckham view incredible £36million flat in Miami</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>How do crystals work?</h2><p id=e1jXe2K3h95- data-wc=42>Crystals (ie smokey quartz. Rose quartz. Black tourmaline etc.) have grown over thousands of years underground. They each have a very specific molecular structure that makes them what they are. This structure vibrates and creates a frequency (think back to physics class).&nbsp;</p><p id=eT5LshSO8R13 data-wc=31>It is this frequency that holds supportive properties when it is aligned with our personal frequency. In a way it creates vibrational balance and as a result, a feeling of wellbeing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d18292260d68-crystals-interview-z.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>What is the one crystal that'll benefit everyone?</h2><p id=eJ5p-tu4IbnS data-wc=23>I would say clear quartz. It is known as the master healer. It amplifies energy. Cleanses and clears vibrational density and stimulates vitality.&nbsp;</p><p id=eRHdZ1hayA_O data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Celebrities who have spoken out about mental health issues</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Where should you put your crystal or crystals?</h2><p id=egRdbYp12w41 data-wc=51>If you have a small crystal I suggest keeping it next to your skin. Crystals vibrate and have a vibrational field that extends around them. If the stone is small, the vibrational field will be smaller so have it close to your skin to encourage entrainment between you and the stone.&nbsp;</p><p id=emWnUrRK6zw9 data-wc=27>If you want a stone to clear your home of low vibration, I’d suggest a smokey quartz or black tourmaline placed in the hallway or living room.</p><p id=ejaZR-lz6143 data-wc=25>Amethyst or lepidolite by the bed can induce calm and sound sleep. These stones should really be bigger if that’s what you want them for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/417cba7c2004-amythyst-z.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Do you need to carry crystals around?</h2><p id=eGsn-fiOhF2n data-wc=45>They can be supportive to have them on your body. I also like to meditate with them at home. I use bigger pieces and still find I can get the same balance.&nbsp;Also, like I said, having them in living spaces can be really beneficial.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>How much do crystals cost on average?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eUl38jP-JTO3 data-wc=69>Wow. Well, they can range depending on size and stone. Some stones are harder to source. Moldavite, for example, can only be found in one place and is actually formed as the result of a meteorite. This makes the stone very expensive to buy, even if it’s tiny. Also, the quality of a stone affects the price. For example, a Brazilian amethyst will cost less than an Uruguayan one.</p><p id=ePXkn8cSdH_S data-wc=21>If you come across a piece at a 'great' price please find out where it’s from and how it is mined.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fe85996bcbc7-crystals-bottle-z.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Where do you buy crystals?</h2><p id=eBfiQSzPbawt data-wc=101>I am very careful to buy my stones from people who know exactly how the crystal is mined. It is something we need to be mindful of. Destroying the planet to have a piece of it totally goes against the "good vibes" concept.&nbsp;That aside, there are great places like Astro gallery in New York which has an amazing museum in the back.&nbsp;Closer to home, Wilde Ones in London King's Road is great.&nbsp;I sell a small number of pieces that I source through my<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Liferocks</a>&nbsp;</strong>website.&nbsp;It’s a bit of a treasure hunt really, but awareness and availability is growing.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Do crystals work differently for different people?</h2><p id=ei7oie4rdNJb data-wc=80>For sure! Sometimes a stone’s vibration can feel too much for someone and make them feel light-headed. Or too slow and lethargic. It’s not always crazy, obvious. Crystals work with the subtle bodies (emphasis on subtle) so simply be aware of your energy levels. Mood etc. If it’s not vibing with you stop using it. It’s not a 'bad' thing or 'wrong'. It’s just what it is. Like people. We don’t all vibe with everyone. Nor should we have to</p><p id=eQoohSabx8co data-wc=1><strong>TIPS:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>How to deal with stress</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Would you say crystals are a form of self-care?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eTKwsRbX7768 data-wc=27>Without a doubt. I do a lot of alignment work with people and many of my clients come twice a month in place of their weekly massage&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>We've seen a rise of facials using crystals - what do you think of this?</h2><p id=eL1urqWV_z5k data-wc=30>Awesome. All growth and use and awareness of working with stones if&nbsp;great if you ask me. As long as people are being mindful of where they are getting them.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/01ae04e6a74e-crystal-facial-z.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Let's talk scenarios! If you have a job interview, what crystal is best?</h2><p id=eld8xQ8S3z96 data-wc=8>Tigers eye for confidence concentration and singular thinking&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>If you're getting married is there a crystal that's good for that?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eFVKC53jyBGE data-wc=46>Blue kyanite is interesting because it works on questioning and realigning ingrained belief patterns. We all hold these over and through our lives and I think in marriage we can come up against a lot of 'shoulds' and 'right and wrong' and 'what married people do'.&nbsp;</p><p id=ei9i57u8PuwS data-wc=36>This stone enables a couple to question beliefs that may not actually be true for them any more and can work around what now works for them in their married life for them as a couple.&nbsp;</p><p id=eAM_PoIgPb3r data-wc=14>Also, this is a great communication stone.

Love. Kindness. Open heartedness. Compassion for self and others!! A great stone for new love.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>If you're pregnant, what crystal would be advised?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eksedJbaMUdS data-wc=15>Carnelian is great because it supports the uterus in pregnancy.
