She also cited numerous other women while accusing them of sexual and physical abuse. T.I. and Tiny vehemently denied the allegations, to which Peterson ended up filing a defamation lawsuit.&nbsp;T.I. and Tiny addressed Peterson’s defamation lawsuit on Monday, arguing that they meant “no malice” when they branded their assault accuser a liar.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At the time of the allegations, T.I. and Tiny released a joint statement explaining the situation. “Whatever we ever have done has been done with consensual adults who into what we into and like what we like,” T.I. said at the time. “We want something, we know exactly where to go to get it, we ain’t never forced nobody, we ain’t never drugged nobody against their will. We ain’t never held nobody against their will, we never made nobody do anything, we never trafficked anything. Well, sexually traffic, anything. I ain’t ever raped nobody.”</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
