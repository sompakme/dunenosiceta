It is not clear if this project is included in that aforementioned deal with The Daily Wire. Keep in mind that this is still only a rumor at this point and should be taken as such. WeGotThisCovered has been spot-on with their <a href=#>scoops</a> before, but until we get official confirmation from either Carano herself or whichever studio she is working with, it is important for us to manage expectations and take this for what it is.</p><p>Gina Carano portrayed the gun-toting Cara Dune in the first two seasons of The Mandalorian. Despite the fact that she survived the events of the show, she has been ousted from the Star Wars universe and will not be appearing in George Lucas’s creation at all moving forward. She was originally supposed to get her own spin-off, but that is obviously not a thing anymore. It’s sad because Lucasfilm had really big plans for her character and was willing to give her so many more opportunities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gina-carano-mandalorian-900x506.jpg><p>If this is the first you are hearing of the Gina Carano situation, let’s dive into a bit of context. Carano was booted from the Star Wars universe in early February after a barrage of <a href=#>inflammatory social media posts</a> angered fans and prompted Disney and Lucasfilm to let her go. Many called for her firing long before it happened, with the hashtag #FireGinaCarano <a href=#>first trending on Twitter</a> in 2020. When she was fired months later, the world was ablaze with anger, vindication, and speculation.</p><p>As for what’s next for Gina Carano’s Star Wars character, the unfortunate answer is nothing. As previously mentioned, Lucasfilm is reportedly simply going to <a href=#>ignore Cara Dune</a> going forward, meaning everything the character was scheduled to appear in has been cancelled or removed from Disney’s release slate. She is not going to appear in anything in the Star Wars universe, including books, video games, etc. Cara Dune is just…gone.</p><p>Gina Carano is an action star through and through, so it is not at all surprising that she is possibly involved in a violent shoot ’em up film reminiscent of the John Wick franchise. She made her breakout role in Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 action thriller Haywire before going on to star in-and <a href=#>get fired from</a> (?)-the Fast and the Furious franchise, with subsequent roles in Deadpool, and, of course, The Mandalorian.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gina-carano-star-wars-900x507.jpg><p>It will be interesting to see if this new movie is the first project in Gina Carano’s new contract with Ben Shapiro or if Hollywood is going back on its decision to blacklist her and taking her back. Either way, the movie will probably do either fairly well or extremely well. People really do seem to enjoy controversy, and Carano has almost as many supporters as she does detractors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ifmaOubq%2FAq5inp12fvKm6jLCgnKNencGuuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-hot-does-sydney-get-in-summer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Hot Does Sydney Get In Summer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eboni-nichols-age-wiki-biography-partner-queen-latifah-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eboni Nichols Age Wiki, Biography , Partner, Queen Latifah, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
