The interpretation came from a 2018 tweet from BossLogic, which imagines Dacre Montgomery as Wolverine in black-and-white and smoking a cigar. This visualization makes Dacre Montgomery look intense in the role, staring straight at the camera, surrounded by smoke and with what looks like massive amounts of hair gel.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>This isn’t the first time that Dacre Montgomery has boosted interest in him playing a popular superhero character in this way. <a href=#>Back in 2017</a>, Dacre Montgomery also posted a photo of Nightwing on his Twitter and Instagram without comment, which led people to think he might be in consideration to join the DC Cinematic Universe. Warner Bros. has been planning a movie focusing on Nightwing, yet in the three years since Montgomery’s post, there has been no update on who will play the character.</p><p>Yet even with Dacre Montgomery posting photos of Wolverine and Nightwing in the past, it doesn’t seem as though the actor has any interest in playing a superhero character at this point. <a href=#>In a video for GQ last year</a>, Dacre Montgomery said he’s more interested in digging into unknown worlds, rather than playing in more prominent, superhero universes. Montgomery also stated that he wasn’t really into superheroes as a kid, although his recent social media use seems to imply that his interest may have grown lately.</p><p><a href=#>Kevin Feige started hinting</a> at the inclusion of the X-Men into the Marvel Cinematic Universe back at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2019. During Marvel’s presentation, Feige said that Marvel Studios was developing films about mutants and in an interview with <a href=#>IGN</a> that whatever Marvel does with the X-Men will be different than Fox’s interpretation. That means Hugh Jackman is almost certainly done with the character, leaving it open for someone like Dacre Montgomery to take on the Adamantium claws.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dacre-Montgomery-22Stranger-Things22-Diet-Workout-Routine-Dacre-Montgomery-as-lifeguard-1280x720-1-edited.jpg><p>Jackman has said that after playing Wolverine for his last time in Logan, he’s fine with someone else taking on the role. Talking to <a href=#>The Daily Beast</a>, Jackman said, “I knew it was the right time for me to leave the party – not just for me, but for the character. Somebody else will pick it up and run with it. It’s too good of a character not to.” While Jackman doesn’t say who he would like to see continue the role, he probably wouldn’t mind another Australian actor like Dacre Montgomery taking up the mantle.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems like the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Phase Four might be when the company debuts the X-Men into their already huge lineup. Disney finally released The New Mutants, the last X-Men film produced by 20th Century Fox, earlier this year. With no plan to continue this series, Marvel has cleared the slate to work on their own iteration of the X-Men.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/stranger-things-season-3-dacre-montgomery-1171792-1280x0-1-edited.jpeg><p>This next period of the Marvel Cinematic Universe seems to focus quite a bit on multiverse craziness, with Spider-Man 3 – coming out on December 17, 2021 – hinted to combine Tom Holland’s recent iteration of Peter Parker with <a href=#>past versions of the character</a>. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness – planned for release on March 25, 2022 – will play with multiverses, as the title implies. Maybe that could include a Dacre Montgomery Wolverine meeting with the rest of the current Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><p>Dacre Montgomery has already had a packed 2020, releasing both True History of the Kelly Gang, and The Broken Hearts Gallery. He’s currently filming Elvis, where he will play producer Steve Binder, alongside Tom Hanks and Austin Butler as Elvis Presley. While Stranger Things Season Four has been confirmed, it is unclear what Dacre Montgomery’s role will be in an upcoming season. While it’s uncertain whether or not Dacre Montgomery is being considered to play Wolverine, BossLogic’s art certainly makes it look like he would make an excellent choice for the role.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ickZi%2FpnnMqKWtn5%2BisrPFjLCmpa6Vp7avsY2hq6ak</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./devon-bagby-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Devon Bagby Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./akosua-busia-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Akosua Busia Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
