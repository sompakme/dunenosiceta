One of my children is dead," the father-of-three told the dispatcher.</p><p>When the dispatcher asked why he thought that, Welch said he had 'no idea'.</p><p>"We just woke up and she's dead," he simply replied.</p><p>Welch then told the dispatcher that Mary wasn't breathing and didn't have a heartbeat.

I was waiting on legal counsel," he said. "I had no idea what to do."</p><p>Fusari told police she had breastfed Mary before going to work at McDonald's on August 1, but that neither parent fed her after that.</p><p>Neither she or Welch went back into Mary's room until the next day. Child Protective Services said they didn't give her any food, water, or even change her diaper.</p><p>The parents, who were also charged with first-degree child abuse, told police that Mary had been sick and low in weight for at least a month before she died.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>But Welch later told WOOD-TV in August that he fed Mary well and did not know she was ill.</p><p>"In the Bible, it says that good food is our medicine.

It's a tragedy...the Lord giveth, the Lord taketh."</p><p>Welch, who has previously dismissed medics as 'priests of the medical cult', said he cared for his children without the aid of professionals because 'going to the doctor nowadays is as dangerous as not going'.</p><p>In a bizarre rant posted onto Facebook two weeks before Mary died, Welch branded medics "skilful magicians and experts in charm".</p><p>"The righteous shall live by faith," he continued. "It's God who is sovereign over disease and those sorts of things and, of course, ultimately deaths."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/h-ajMRCQpJ-ayzb2OoaMM-DkTXI=/16x16/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/T76NNQCHOLCYWZZSMPVJJTSJ2Q.jpg"><p>Welch has since claimed he is being "made an example of" because of his "very strong faith" and said Mary's autopsy was conducted "lazily".</p><p>His defense argued on Wednesday that the infant may have suffered from a metabolic disorder that kept her from absorbing nutrients.</p><p>But Dr David Start, the forensic pathologist that performed Mary's autopsy, said he found no metabolic diseases or parasites, according to MLive.com.</p><p>And Judge Sara Smolenski disagreed with the defense's argument that the parents had unknowingly harmed Mary.</p><p>"It is as horrific as it gets," she told the courtroom. "The skeletal-like posture of the child, in my opinion, speaks volumes for how long the baby was not cared for properly."</p><p>Smolenski said she was also struck by Welch's callousness in the 911 call after discovering his daughter was dead.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>One investigator revealed that there was limited baby food in the house, which was covered with mice feces and flies.</p><p>Mary's bed was also filthy and even appeared to have mold growing on it, they added.</p><p>The family farm where the couple lived was littered with signs condemning evil and ordering nonbelievers to "repent and obey".</p><p>One message painted across a wooden fence reads "My kingdom is not of this world", while others say "Blessed are the peacemakers", "Every knee shall bow and every throne will confess to God" and "God knows what you need before you ask".</p><p>Photos from inside the couple's home show handmade wooden desks and chairs, bare walls and images of their young children working on crafts.</p><p>Welch often posted videos criticizing worldly things and encouraging believers to "live off the grid".</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>In another Facebook video, Welch explained why he refused to vaccinate any of his offspring.</p><p>"It doesn't seem smart that you would be saving people who weren't the fittest," he said.</p><p>"If evolution believes in survival of the fittest, why are we vaccinating everybody? Shouldn't we just let the weak die off and let the strong survive?"</p><p>Welch and Fusari are currently being held without bond.
