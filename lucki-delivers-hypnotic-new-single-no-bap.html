Of course, you could say this about any artist. After all, you have to love an artist to be a fan. However, Lucki's <a href=# rel>fans are different</a>. Overall, he gets the crowd going at his shows. This is especially true at festivals such as Rolling Loud, where his fans are always turning up. He may not be the most energetic performer out there, but he knows how to get the fans involved. Moreover, he is very consistent with his releases, which helps build his fanbase.</p><p>One issue that a lot of artists run into is that they don't actually drop anything. Subsequently, fans feel a little bit alienated and then check out. However, Lucki has made it his mission to make sure that this does not happen to him. Just a month ago, he dropped a dope <a href=# rel>new song called "Leave Her."</a> Fans dug this track, and now, he is about to follow up on that success. Below, you can find another new song from Lucki, this time called "No Bap."</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lucki-delivers-nonchalant-flows>Lucki Delivers Nonchalant Flows</h2></span><p>With this new effort, Lucki hits fans with some chilled-out yet hypnotic production. As for his vocals, he delivers the perfect flow for this kind of vibe. He just lets the beat come to him, and it makes for a very pleasant song. Additionally, at just over two minutes long, you can't say this song overstays its welcome. It's yet another amazing and solid release from the artist.</p><p>Hopefully, this latest string of releases means that an album is coming out soon. Lucki is an artist that fans are always begging for a new project, and with the summer on the horizon, that would be a huge moment. Let us know what you think of this song, down below.
