He poured around $250,000 into ethereum — although this would be worth substantially less now after the cryptocurrency crash.</p><p>He also bought an NFT valued at over $165,000 and sold a plot of land in Facebook’s virtual reality, Metaverse, for $150,000.</p><p>“It came to a time when I had over $1 million liquid just sitting there,” he said. “To me personally I hate dead money, I’d rather go through and invest it.”<br></p><p>With his fortune growing, Mr Zayya resolved to buy his first property.</p><p>“My goal is to have 10 properties by the age of 30,” Mr Zayya said.</p><p>He’s well on the way, with four under his belt already at the age of 24.</p><p>In April last year, he snapped up his first property, a Wollongong house for $1.3 million.</p><p>He had to pay a 20 per cent deposit but because of his massive fortune, it took just seven days for a bank to approve his home loan.</p><p>Then just two months later, in June, when Australia’s property craze was in full swing, Mr Zayya snapped up two more properties.</p><p>One was a similar price to his first purchase, at $1.31 million, and he also bought a block of units in an off-market deal for $1.55 million.</p><p>“I got renters in straight away, nothing stays not rented, at most five days,” he said, explaining they were all positively geared.</p><p>With property values across Australia increasing by an average of 25 per cent last year, Mr Zayya also experienced some windfalls after he got his homes re-evaluated by the bank.</p><p>His first house valued at $1.32 million rose to $1.72 million and the $1.31 million property is now worth $1.73 million.</p><p>His best investment was the $1.55 million block of units which ballooned to $2.1 million.</p><p>Using equity from those, he was able to buy his fourth property earlier this month, a block of two units for $1.275 million.</p><p>“It’s essentially a free property because of the equity,” he added.</p><p>“This brings total yearly rental income approximately all my properties to $258,000.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyzscClZJ6rpJbBpnvBrrCippdktbDDjGtrsqddqruqecOrpqmnpal6rq3KnqpmamVluG6tjLKcmqpdmbyqusZmpaismJ67qHvNnq6sZaOpvLPFjp1nbmllmIFzssJpbpxrkZaAp4LAaW2aa5Jshnh%2Fk2mc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shield-creator-explains-vic-mackey-s-fate.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shield creator explains Vic Mackeys fate</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-leonard-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Leonard Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
