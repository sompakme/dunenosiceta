Instead, he told Frey that he was a widower. Frey started working with the authorities during the investigation and little by little, the inconsistencies in Scott's story were revealed, as noted by <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>. In April 2003, the decomposed body of a woman and a fetus were discovered on the bay. The autopsy showed that the remains belonged to Laci Peterson and her unborn baby, and an arrest warrant for Scott was issued shortly after.</p><p dir=ltr>As reported by the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>, authorities had been closely monitoring Scott's movements for months, as they feared that he might take off. He was driving erratically when he was apprehended near the La Jolla golf course. Inside his vehicle, authorities found clothing, camping gear, missing person flyers for Laci, a few cellphones, Viagra pills, and about $15,000 in cash (via <a href=#>People</a>). His appearance had also changed, as he grew a beard and dyed his hair blonde. Scott was charged with two counts of felony murder under special circumstances and was held without bail; he pleaded not guilty. In addition, Laci's family also filed a civil lawsuit against Scott in order to prevent him from receiving monetary compensation for selling his story to the media. The prosecution stated that Scott murdered Laci to escape his marriage and fatherhood. They claimed that he tossed Laci's body in the water when he went to the marina on the day he reported his wife missing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFl25wbm5fqbWmedOrrKWxXZ28s77In6CcZZOntq6xjKyanqaVYrynecuamqJloJrBpr7SqKVo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-color-attracts-positive-energy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What color attracts positive energy?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-most-iconic-supermodels-of-the-00s.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Most Iconic Supermodels of the '00s</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
