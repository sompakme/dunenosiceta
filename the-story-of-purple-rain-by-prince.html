I called him back and said, 'I can't do it. I wish I could. It's too much for me.'"</p><p class=paragraph-text>Prince then asked his backing band to try the song: "I want to try something before we go home. It's mellow."</p><p class=paragraph-text>According to Lisa Coleman, Prince changed the song dramatically after Wendy Melvoin started playing the guitar to accompany the song: "He was excited to hear it voiced differently. It took it out of that country feeling.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"Then we all started playing it a bit harder and taking it more seriously. We played it for six hours straight and by the end of that day we had it mostly written and arranged."</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=8><h2 class=title>Purple Rain meaning: What is the song about?</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/TvnYmWpD_T8/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Prince - Purple Rain (Official Video)</p><p class=paragraph-text>Prince explained the meaning of 'Purple Rain' as:</p><p class=paragraph-text>"When there's blood in the sky â€“ red and blue = purple... purple rain pertains to the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your faith/god guide you through the purple rain."</p><p class=paragraph-text>The title track of Prince's previous album, 1999, also included similar references to an ominous purple sky ("...could have sworn it was Judgment Day, the sky was all purple...").</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=15><h2 class=title>Prince was worried about copying Journey</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/OMD8hBsA-RI/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Journey - Faithfully (Official Video)</p><p class=paragraph-text>After recording the song, Prince phoned Journey member Jonathan Cain, to ask him to listen to it.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Prince was concerned that it might be too similar to Journey's 'Faithfully', a song composed by Cain which had recently been in the US charts.</p><p class=paragraph-text>However, Cain reassured Prince by saying that the songs only shared the same four chords.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"I thought it was an amazing tune," Cain said. "I told him, 'Man, I'm just super-flattered that you even called. It shows you're that classy of a guy. Good luck with the song. I know it's gonna be a hit.'"</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=18><h2 class=title>The song formed the basis of the Purple Rain movie</h2><p class=paragraph-text>The album Purple Rain was actually the soundtrack to the first movie Prince made. The film won Prince an Oscar for Best Original Song Score.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The song itself was the centrepiece of the film and a main plot point. In the movie, the female members of Prince's band, Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, write a song that Prince ignores.</p><p class=paragraph-text>This sparks a rant from Wendy ("Every time we give you a song you say you're going to use it but you never do. You're being paranoid as usual..."). At the end of the film, Prince's crew has a showdown with another band (The Time). When Prince takes the stage, he introduces 'Purple Rain' as being written by Wendy and Lisa, then plays an incredible show.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Wendy and Lisa were actually real members of Prince's band The Revolution until 1987, when they left to form a duo.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=10><h2 class=title>It was the last song Prince ever performed</h2><p class=paragraph-text>'Purple Rain' was a staple of Prince's live performances.</p><p class=paragraph-text>At the Super Bowl XLI's halftime show, 'Purple Rain' was the last song of Prince's set and appropriately started during a downpour at the stadium. When combined with the purple stage lighting, it created the song's signature image.</p><p class=paragraph-text>It was also the final song Prince performed live during his final concert in Atlanta, Georgia on April 14, 2016. He died a week later.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=4.8940677966102><h2 class=title>How did it perform in the charts?</h2><p class=paragraph-text>The song peaked at number two in the US, behind 'Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go' by <a href=#>Wham!</a></p><p class=paragraph-text>In the UK, it peaked at number 8.
