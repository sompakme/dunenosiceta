That ethos has served them well for over 14 years now, with big names coming back for not only the experience but the integrity in the treatments and their pride in being a private oasis that has zero signage outside.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLuP-YDdsQ data-wc=63>That integrity includes Lena only ever offering what she thinks you need. "The skin is an ever evolving organ and what you see in front of you at that moment is a snapshot as to what is going on with that person; it speaks to you and experience allows you to use appropriate tools and products to address those specific needs," she says.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d19294852150-carasoin-products.jpg><p id=ewrno1bUm8 data-wc=56>"Sometimes, like post-travel it will be deep cleaning, or depuffing to bring the skin back to life, or now, in the midst of red carpet season, it will be focusing on oxygen infusion, to make sure the skin looks fresh and glowing, and a CACI Microcurrent to give that sculpting and lifting effect, ready for cameras."&nbsp;</p><p id=eBR2mybTkX data-wc=67>"In some cases it’s about both restoring the skin and also prepping it for the next event," she adds. "Fortunately, with a lot of clients I see them all year round and then intensively during awards season so I know exactly how to plan their treatments at different times for what they have gone through, are about to go through, and get them ready for the next."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Why 'life-changing' transformation retreats are set to be 2024's biggest travel trend" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ce249da0d782-retreat-1.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Why 'life-changing' transformation retreats are set to be 2024's biggest travel trend" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Why 'life-changing' transformation retreats are set to be 2024's biggest travel trend</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e7tgDYbhBI data-wc=45>As for anyone who doesn't have Lena's phone number on hand, her number one tip is to always find some time to focus on your skin, whether it's a short facial massage while cleansing or taking 20 mins at the end of week to mask.&nbsp;</p><p id=eK3lSA5klL data-wc=62>"As aestheticians, there's only so much we can do in a 60 or 90-minute facial and year round skin health lies with you at home. I’m a big believer in masks and it can be as simple as mixing ingredients you can find in the store or your fridge such as Greek Yogurt, Oatmeal, Apple Cider Vinegar and strong brewed green tea."&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">My experience at West Hollywood's A-List spa Carasoin</h3><p id=ef2S6-So0o>You don't enter Carasoin through the busy streets of Beverly Hills but instead from a spa garden tucked down a secret alley, with trickling water fountains and an immediate sense of tranquility. Then you meet Lena, who radiates that same energy – safe and calm – and you know you're in good hands. No wonder Ryan Gosling has been going to her for over 13 years.&nbsp;</p><p id=eCbFxLXoRV>After a thorough consultation – and the welcome news that I have excellent collagen and elasticity in my skin – Lena got to work and what followed was the most relaxing 90 minutes I've had in recent memory, as she cleansed, blasted, sculpted and lifted my face. My main concerns were redness and dryness, and despite my attempts at slowing down the aging process, she warned me away from retinol for a while, as there was too much exfoliation going on with the AHA, BHA and retinoids for my sensitive skin.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b021774e45df-rebeccalewis-carasoin.jpg><p id=edluxqR3-g>Lena began with a cleanse before using the first of three different machines, an ultrasonic exfoliation which she describes as "an amazing tool to gently exfoliate and loosen dead skin cells while still being suitable for even the most delicate skin". Light extractions followed before using High Frequency to sterilize and close the pores, and then it was my favorite part – a manual massage where Lena combined lymph drainage techniques and modellage to start contouring and warming up the muscles.&nbsp;</p><p id=eWWvk3k4pr>Checking in with me periodically, and always more than happy to answer my questions about what was happening, Lena's passion and knowledge was clear, explaining how a certain machine worked – "was that a vacuum or a powerjet?" I asked after the Oxygen infusion, which is used to hydrate via a custom blended serum that contains Hyaluronic acids for hydration, horse chestnut extract to target redness and inflammation, as well as peptides and niacinamide for preventive anti aging benefits. She also warned me about the immediate side effects of a treatment; the CACI Microcurrent, which leaves a short-lived metallic taste in your mouth but the visual effect is a lifted and sculpted look with zero downtime.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXc1rUTf92>Facials are not miracle workers, and I don't now have clear perfect skin, despite my wishes. Immediately after my skin felt raw in many ways, and I personally would not have wanted to put make-up over the top.&nbsp;</p><p id=eM6FtkmpIr>But two days later, I can definitely see the difference the CACI Microcurrent made, and Lena's advice to go back to basics and step away from the exfoliator has seen the redness around my cheeks die down, and the texture has improved dramatically.</p><p id=eeZojYfnST>The extractions – obviously – left small red marks but they have all but vanished at this point, and without makeup my skin does look and feel brighter. The true test, however, will be what it feels like come Oscars Sunday, when I have to apply enough makeup to last 12+ hours and will be drinking too much caffeine and probably champagne…</p><p id=eWvDQeVx0e></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGxqbWBrg3C1jK2pop2UYrWwuMuyrqinlGKzoq%2FImqNmnaaWeq6xzZ2crGWirq6vecaoqqWhnpx6pLXLpaCapl2iwrO8x7JkoKSfrLavs44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jada-pinkett-smith-s-former-partner-august-alsina-makes-surprise-revelation.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jada Pinkett Smiths former partner August Alsina makes surprise revelation</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-many-zip-codes-in-california.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Many Zip Codes In California</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
