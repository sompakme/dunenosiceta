Tony Khan is making plans for a Saturday show as well, so we’ll have to see if anything changes for those wrestlers who haven’t been around.</p><p>Miro used to be Rusev in WWE, and he wasn’t used very well by Vince McMahon. He was eventually granted a release from the company, and then he started with AEW. Despite all the hype and expectation, Miro fell flat in AEW as well.</p><p>The <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a> provided a bit of an update on Miro. At this time, there is nothing new. He is still sitting at home, while on the AEW roster. It seems that there is no creative for him at all at this time.</p><p>Regarding some frequently asked questions of late. There is nothing new on Miro. He’s on the roster and hasn’t been used.</p><p>It was also noted that Leyla Hirsch is also still on the roster, but still injured. The young start ended up on the DL after her surgery for a torn ACL in late May. It was reported that she has been to at least one show recently.</p><p>We’ll have to see if Miro and Leyla Hirsch can make it back to AEW television so they can continue their journeys with Tony Khan’s company. Only time will tell what the future holds, but it doesn’t seem like either of them are gearing up for an immediate return.</p><p>What’s your take on Miro’s time in AEW? Did Tony Khan drop the ball with him? Sound off in the comments!</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
