The pickup, which had been in the works for some time, comes as the strikes-impacted 20th season recently returned to the network.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The renewal will bring the Shonda Rhimes-created medical drama to its second season under <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/greys-anatomy-renewed-season-20-abc-1235360499/ rel="noreferrer noopener">new showrunner Meg Marinis, </a>who took over at the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/krista-vernoff-checks-out-as-showrunner-of-greys-anatomy-station-19-1235309927/ rel="noreferrer noopener">end of season 19 for Krista Vernoff</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Marinis has been with&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy&nbsp;since its third season and had worked her way up since beginning her tenure on the show as a writer’s production assistant. She then worked as a writers’ assistant and medical researcher before moving up the chain of command to executive producer, a title she held for the past four seasons before being promoted to the big chair. &nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“The loyalty and love of Grey’s Anatomy fans has propelled us into a historic 21st season, and I could not be more grateful,” Rhimes said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “Meg Marinis’ storytelling is a gift that continues to keep the show vibrant, compelling and alive, and I can’t wait to see what she has in store for next season.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">No details about returning cast have been revealed as Grey’s historically sees turnover as part of its ongoing storytelling. Leading lady <a href=# id=auto-tag_ellen-pompeo data-tag=ellen-pompeo>Ellen Pompeo</a> is expected to continue to remain involved after departing ahead of season 20 as a series regular. Pompeo’s Meredith Grey continues to provide her trademark voiceover on Grey’s and the actress and her ABC Signature-based Calamity Jane banner exec produces the series.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The actress is expected to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>appear in at least four episodes</a> of the abbreviated 20th season as she juggles production on her forthcoming <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">limited series for Hulu</a>. Season 20 consists of only 10 episodes after last year’s dual strikes delayed production and dramatically impacted the broadcast schedule.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Grey’s remains the longest running primetime medical drama in TV history after surpassing ER in 2019. The drama also ranks as ABC’s longest-running primetime scripted series in the network’s rich history. The vast library of episodes recently debuted on Hulu alongside Netflix, opening up the series to a wave of new viewers on the platform.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Grey’s Anatomy becomes the third ABC series to earn an early renewal for the 2024-25 broadcast season, joining <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/abbott-elementary-renewed-season-4-abc-1235821584/>Quinta Brunson’s Abbott Elementary</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/911-renewed-season-8-abc-1235864626/>Ryan Murphy’s 911</a>. CBS has already picked up Fire Country, Ghosts, Tracker and NCIS: Sydney; Fox is returning Animal Control and nearly its full animated slate; while NBC has picked up new seasons of five of its six Dick Wolf procedurals and rookies Found and The Irrational.
