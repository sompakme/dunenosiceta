Through word of mouth and customer reviews, the Pre-Wash Hair Oil Treatment has quickly become a cult-favorite product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In India, people pretty much oil their hair daily. But in the Western world, many people had never oiled their hair in their life," Mehta says of scalp care's rise in popularity. "It's wonderful to see people open their minds to the importance of taking care of your hair and scalp."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, Mehta shares the importance of Ayurveda har rituals to the Indian community, his tips for incorporating hair oil massages into your routine, and more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What inspired Fable & Mane?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Growing up, my sister and I were surrounded by Ayurveda hair rituals. The name Fable & Mane comes from the rituals my grandma used to do to our hair while reading us incredible fables. Unfortunately, our grandparents passed away, and we started looking to our roots and traditions. My sister and I realized the market didn't have any Ayurveda haircare brands, so we wanted to create products we could still enjoy with our busy schedules while celebrating our childhood memories.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What are the haircare benefits does Ayurveda offer?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The main thing to know is that Ayurveda is a 4,000-year-old ancient science that's been passed down for generations. The benefits of being time tested and proven. The ingredients are natural herbs and oils that have been proven to help hair growth and provide essential nutrients to the scalp. It can be especially effective to pair the ingredients with a head massage because it increases the blood flow in your scalp. This is really what we're trying to bring to the haircare industry: incredible ingredients that are proven to provide essential vitamins and nutrients to your hair, along with the ritual associated with them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>With scalp care rising in popularity, what do you think is one misconception people have about hair oils?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First, it's important to understand your hair type and the condition of your scalp. Once you have your foundation, next comes figuring out what oils your hair and scalp needs because there are different types. One differentiation is pre-wash versus leave-in oils. Finally, you need to factor in your wash days, because sometimes less is more. As a rule of thumb, I say use a pre-wash treatment once a week. For leave-in treatments, listen to your hair type and recognize how easily your hair absorbs oil. If it absorbs oil easily, you may be able to top off your hair throughout the day as needed, whereas hair that doesn't absorb oil as easily may only use it once every few days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What product from the line do you think is an essential in any haircare routine?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Definitely the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Pre-Wash Hair Oil Treatment</a>. It's the hero product and it has all of the best Indian Ayruveda ingredients in it. Ashwagandha is an adaptogen that encourages hair growth and dashmool is a blend of 10 roots that promote calmness and wellbeing, and it also smells really good because our scents are created by the same perfumer as Dior. We've seen the best consumer feedback through word of mouth and consumer trials. It's a product I feel confident giving to anyone without knowing the history of their hair and scalp. Also, it's an easy way to incorporate a ritual into your haircare routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What do you hope to see change in the haircare space?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From a business perspective, I want stores to increase shelf space for haircare brands. I want haircare to get the recognition it deserves through retail, online, and social media. With COVID, salons were closed and people started looking beyond styling and how to actually fix their hair at the root, so the category has seen a lot of growth. Personally, I want to see more collaboration less competition. My mission isn't for everyone to have a full Fable & Mane ritual, but to have at least one Fable & Mane product in their cabinet. Together we grow stronger, so more collaboration is my personal goal in the haircare industry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Things You're Probably Doing That Make Split Ends Worse</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shop-fable--manes-haircare-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shop Fable & Mane's Haircare Products</span></h2><span class=heading-toc id=toc-holiroots-pre-wash-hair-treatment-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>HoliRoots Pre-wash Hair Treatment Oil</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Powered by Indian adaptogen ashwagandha, Fable & Mane's pre-shower oil strengthens hair from the root and nourishes the scalp to create optimal growth conditions.
