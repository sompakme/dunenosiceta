The Agency, which was founded by Mauricio Umansky, is actually the subject of another reality show distributed by Netflix, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/buying-beverly-hills-cast/>Buying Beverly Hills</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I am super excited to be back at The Agency.

"I came back because I'm very serious about where I want my real estate career to go. I know that this is where I have to be to succeed in real estate. It felt right, I always missed them.

As for who she's kept in touch with, Vanessa said she and Maya stay in touch a lot, while she also messages "here and there" with Christine.
