On one end of the spectrum, we’re seeing a return to the classics. “I’m seeing a shift to a more minimalistic version of trends,” says Tweezerman celebrity manicurist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login-submit referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Tom Bachik</a>, who works with stars like <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/selena-gomez/>Selena Gomez</a> and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/jennifer-lopez/>Jennifer Lopez</a>. “Things are getting simpler and cleaner.” Shorter nails are taking the place of extra long acrylics, fun finishes like chrome and velvet are pushing bright, bold designs to the sideline, and French manicures, which received a funky twist as one of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-redirect=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/nail-trends-2022/ data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/nail-trends-2023/>2022's nail trends</a>, are becoming even more dainty and elegant.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, spring and summer are giving birth to bold aesthetics, bright hues, and fun prints. "Like our wardrobe, nails need a bit of transitioning phase, and I expect to see more colorful French tips in early summer," says LeChat Brand Educator Hemi Park. "Big bright shades will always be summer staples, but we will be seeing more wild and adventurous designs on our tips and toes."<br></p><p>Don’t get me wrong: There are absolutely no rules when it comes to picking your perfect manicure. But, if you want the inside scoop on what’s going to be debuted on red carpets, Instagram, and on magazine covers over the next few months, scroll ahead. I tapped the best nail pros in the business to create a guide to the biggest nail trends in 2023. So pin this page, screenshot your favorites, and scroll ahead to prep for your next manicure.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-mermaid-inspired-manis><span>Mermaid-Inspired Manis</span></h2><p>Spring and summer runway collections featured sequined fabrics and metallic bags galore. Add the upcoming My Little Mermaid release to the list, and it shouldn't come as a surprise that the combination gave birth to a new nail trend: Mermaidcore. "Blue and green toned shifting metallics and glitter textures will definitely hit the digits," says Park. "We’ve all witnessed chrome galore in nails, but in more eye-capturing duo-chrome shades like <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://lechatnails.com/product/perfect-match-metallux-siren-song/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>LECHAT Perfect Match Siren Song</u></a>. It's a mess-free liquid chrome gel and lacquer duo, for extra easy application."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-reptile-prints><span>Reptile Prints</span></h2><p>We're calling it: Reptile skin patterns will be perfectly exotic and suitable for summer vacay mani. And get this: It's actually relatively easy to DIY. "To achieve reptile skin pattern at home, add a generous amount of base coat over the base color, then gently dab darker shade lacquer oval dots over the wet base coat to create blooming effect," says Park. "Allow longer time to dry your nails before applying your favorite top coat."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-bold-aesthetics><span>Bold Aesthetics</span></h2><p>Solid nail shades and minimal designs are going to be constant through the entirety of 2023, but you can expect to see a spike of bright hues, exciting prints, and a little extra action in Spring and Summer, according to Park. French tips and tie dye hues are going to be at the forefront.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-natural-length><span>Natural Length</span></h2><p>Extra long acrylic nails have a time and place (we’ll forever be obsessed with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/cardi-b-duck-feet-nails/>Cardi B’s duck nails</a>). That all said, this year the trend is going the opposite direction. “Last year it was all about super long nails and crazy, abstract nail art, this year we are taking a more classic approach,” explains nail artist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/hannahs_of_somerset/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Hannah Thayer.</a> “Everyone is starting to embrace a more natural nail length instead of the artificial, long nails,” adds consulting manicurist for Dashing Diva <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.thewallgroup.com/artist/zola-ganzorigt referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Zola Ganzorigt</a>, who works with clients like Hailey Bieber. “When it comes to shape, a medium almost shape is the most popular because it’s the most durable for natural nails.” &nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-chrome-finishes><span>Chrome Finishes</span></h2><p>If there was one beauty moment that defined 2022, it was Hailey Bieber’s glazed donut nails—the silver version, the brown version, and the Rhode gray version. And we’re happy to report that the chrome gorgeousness is here to stay. “Glazed donut and chrome nails are in because they are minimalist, chic, and work across the different seasons,” says Ganzorigt. “It’s becoming easier to try these trends with the explosion of at-home press on and nail strip options. I always point my clients to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://dashingdiva.com/collections/glazed-donut?utm_source=paidsearch&utm_medium=google&utm_campaign=&utm_content=511037680318&utm_term=diva%20nails&gclid=Cj0KCQiAlKmeBhCkARIsAHy7WVv3HlTUv6_ulZTD0u7MAsKJ9S59C30TY4fgSGEVJ8SJ_C-E4cUFvZAaAlzqEALw_wcB" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdashingdiva.com%2Fcollections%2Fglazed-donut%3Futm_source%3Dpaidsearch%26utm_medium%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D%26utm_content%3D511037680318%26utm_term%3Ddiva%2520nails%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAlKmeBhCkARIsAHy7WVv3HlTUv6_ulZTD0u7MAsKJ9S59C30TY4fgSGEVJ8SJ_C-E4cUFvZAaAlzqEALw_wcB&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fbeauty%2Fnail-trends-2023" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - dashingdiva.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined>Dashing Diva</a> for this—they have a huge variety to choose from, ranging from seasonal colors to intricate nail art designs.”</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-diy-dreams><span>DIY Dreams</span></h2><p>If going to the salon isn’t your preference, you’re in serious luck. Brands across the board continue to amp up innovation and turn out gorgeous press-ons, nail stickers, and at-home kits in just about every shape, size, and finish. “There are so many velvet magnetic nails, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g32393520/best-press-on-nails/>press-on nails</a>, and gel nail strips to choose from at home,” says Ganzorigt. Need some inspo on where to look? Check out brands like O.P.I., Manime, and Static Nails.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-seasonal-shades><span>Seasonal Shades</span></h2><p>Because funky designs are taking a backseat this year, the trend is to really lean in to a season-appropriate shade. “Clean, one colors are becoming more popular,” explains Aprés Nail’s Research and Development Manager <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/eunicornnails/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Eunice Park</a>. “Like the viral ‘red nail theory’ trend, people are enjoying the clean simplicity of a precise one color application.” So whether you lean into moody <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/g3310/best-nail-colors-winter/>winter nail shades</a> like dark burgundy, dark brown, and black, or go with a sheer nude (Park likes the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://apresnail.com/collections/gel-colors/products/apgcset-3 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Gel Couleur</a> series from Aprés Nail), you can’t go wrong.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-french-manicure-evolution><span>French Manicure Evolution</span></h2><p>This is an evolution if there ever was one. The traditional French mani pretty much dominated in the early 2000s. But it then went MIA for around two decades only to come back and be better than ever. Fun color combos had their time to shine, but this year the look has become even sleeker than the OG. “French manicures are thinning the tips to just be guided edges,” explains Bachik. For those that want to have a little more fun? “Add a glitter liner.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-lip-gloss-nails><span>Lip Gloss Nails</span></h2><p>You know the gorgeous shine on your lips post lip gloss application? Envision that same, sheer stunning-ness on your nails. The look has appropriately been dubbed “The Lip Gloss Nail,” and can be done in a wide, wide, wide range of shades. “Full coverage nudes are becoming more sheer and glossier,” Bachik points out, but you can also achieve this look with pale pinks or even see-through reds.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-moody-mattes><span>Moody Mattes</span></h2><p>If something like a Lip Gloss Nail is not your speed, allow me to introduce you to the moody matte—it’s quite literally the polar opposite. “I absolutely cannot get enough of deeper, moody tones (think: blues and greens) finished with a matte topcoat,” says Thayer. “The matte adds an unexpected level of elegance to dark nails.” To get the look, she recommends using Dazzle Dry in <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://dazzledry.com/products/self-made?variant=39770385809510&gclid=Cj0KCQiAlKmeBhCkARIsAHy7WVuTOzq0cjUAL1yUVMl1K7LLebUjr5Fkw63ygDl22wZ39VXS8Zu2O9kaAjmjEALw_wcB" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Self Made</a> or <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://dazzledry.com/products/mythic-teal?variant=39770336165990&gclid=Cj0KCQiAlKmeBhCkARIsAHy7WVv48yOD0Cq13TAIgi_M2MIl5dUfcxPwvblw_FsVRtU8ojPjaUSz1NEaAsctEALw_wcB" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Mythic Teal </a>with the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://dazzledry.com/products/mattifying-top-coat?variant=1460794032172&gclid=Cj0KCQiAlKmeBhCkARIsAHy7WVvj1n0NlonNqB-9C7iumj7dXZrUHTcToBSJpjyl5aGyW7Ml8F2Sx60aApNVEALw_wcB" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Mattify Top Coat</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-return-of-the-accent-nail><span>The Return of the Accent Nail</span></h2><p>Never did I ever think I’d see the day, but the single accent nail has returned. “For those wanting a little extra flair, try choosing a simple design on one or two nails to accent an otherwise neutral toned mani,” says Thayer. “I love to pop in some gold foil or leopard spots, because who doesn’t love leopard?” You can also do a simple line down the center, or if all else fails, just pop on a sticker.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-simplistic-dimension><span>Simplistic Dimension</span></h2><p>“Three-D nails are becoming more simplified, like a sprinkle of pixie dust or a single crystal,” says Bachik. The subtle addition adds a little extra fun to an otherwise classic manicure, but remains simple, chic, and sophisticated. One of the best ways to get the look at home is to order little rhinestones and pop ‘em on the base of each nail with a pointed tweezer.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-toss-in-texture><span>Toss in Texture</span></h2><p>In the same way that glazed donut nails have risen to stardom, a handful of other textures are getting their well deserved 15 minutes of fame. “Chunky glitters are now becoming more like shimmers and pearls,” says Bachik. Take the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.essie.com/nail-polish/enamel/metallics-and-glitters/no-place-like-chrome referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Essie Chromes </a>collection, for instance. “They’re more sheer and iridescent.” The same can be said for the velvet nail trend.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-minamalistic-manis><span>Minamalistic Manis</span></h2><p>Sometimes, the best manicure requires no polish at all. “It’s the most minimalistic, but sometimes a clean, perfectly manicured natural nail is the way to go,” says Bachik. “I think this is blowing up because it allows DIYs to take their favorite celebrity look and simplify it.” &nbsp;Now, while this might not be the *most* exciting look in the book, it’s by and large the easiest to DIY. “Everything you need to achieve this is in my<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.tweezerman.com/tweezerman-x-tom-bachik-ultimate-nail-care-set-2022.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adpos=&scid=scplp4202-R&sc_intid=4202-R&gclid=Cj0KCQiAlKmeBhCkARIsAHy7WVvOwzAr6rA4VKPCPTQrpV3VJuewd7EwgV4V3vv0f-CmLGzfeuXtQ6EaAm6bEALw_wcB" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> Tweezerman x Tom Bachik Ultimate Nail Care Set</a>.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-nail-artists><span>Meet the Nail Artists</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg><span class=person__name>Zola Ganzorigt </span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Celebrity Manicurist and Consulting Manicurist for Dashing Diva<p>Zola Ganzorigt is a Los Angeles-based manicurist.
