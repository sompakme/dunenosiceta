Filler is typically made of hyaluronic acid (HA) and is injected to areas like the jaw, cheeks, lips, and under the eyes to help fill wrinkles, enhance shallow contours, and increase volume. As fillers typically dissolve in one to two years, many get fresh filler every six or so months to maintain their preferred look. However, some of those may go into the treatment office wondering if they should get their existing filler dissolved.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've asked yourself the same question, worry not. Unlike Botox (and other forms of botulinum toxin nerve blocks) hyaluronic acid fillers can be reversed. So, if you’ve ever found yourself wondering things like “How long does filler stay in the body?,” “When should I dissolve my filler?,” or “What does dissolving filler feel like?” — worry not. To answer these questions, InStyle tapped board-certified plastic surgeon <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Dr. Stafford Broumand</a> to learn everything there is to know about dissolving fillers.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-dermal-fillers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are dermal fillers?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Filler is a gel-like substance used to treat and sculpt various areas of the face. From plumping the lips, to filling hollow under-eyes, sharpening jaw lines, and filling wrinkles around the mouth and eyes —filler is used for a range of treatments.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-different-types-of-dermal-fillers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are the different types of dermal fillers?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As previously mentioned, filler is typically made of hyaluronic acid, but there are a few other options available depending on where you want it injected and your desired results. According to Dr. Broumand, a rule of thumb to keep in mind is: the longevity of filler depends on the type used and where it’s injected — the more mobility the injected area has, the quicker the filler dissolves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The watery ones tend to dissolve faster, the stiffer ones stay longer. If you have a stiffer product and you put it somewhere deep on the bone like the jawline, there’s not much movement there [so] it stays longer. The same with the cheek bone,” the doctor shares. “You put it to the mouth — it’s always moving so it tends to dissipate more.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As far as the different types of fillers, there are the classic hyaluronic acid fillers (such as Restylane and Juvederm), which is the most common filler for wrinkles. HA is found in the body as a natural component of the skin’s connective tissue, and HA fillers typically last anywhere from six to twelve months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are harder fillers like Calcium hydroxylapatite (like Radiesse) which are typically used to contour areas like cheeks, jaw line, and deeper wrinkles. They can last anywhere from one to three years.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There is permanent soft tissue filler (like Bellafill) which cannot dissolve naturally in the body, so these fillers are generally used to smooth deep wrinkles around the mouth (a highly mobile area where filler usually dissolves faster).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And finally, there are Poly-L-lactic acid fillers (like Sculptra), which use a powder that is put into a solution and injected into the body. This makes collagen, and that concludes in thicker results, so it dissolves slower. Sculptra can stick around in the body for up to two years.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-should-you-layer-dermal-filler></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When should you layer dermal filler?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s like filling a gas tank — your tank is empty after a year. Most people say ‘I don’t like driving the car until it’s empty,' so when you pass the gas station and the tank is half empty, fill it up again. When you have filler, it’s the same way — you don’t necessarily say ‘I like this look, I’m going to wait until I’m at empty and then I’m going to fix it up again,'” says Dr. Broumand. Therefore, if filler lasts a year, he suggests you get a refill at the six-month mark to maintain your look.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-should-you-dissolve-dermal-filler></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When should you dissolve dermal filler?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Broumand, if filler is done right and not overdone, you should only have to dissolve filler if there’s been a mistake. Mistakes can include uneven volume, migrating, or simply not liking the results. “There’s no concrete answer when to dissolve other than if it doesn’t look right,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, what constitutes as “overdoing” it? Layering filler at multiple appointments over a short timeframe. Since most fillers dissolve between six months and two years, getting multiple syringes in, say, a three-month timeframe to build up volume before any of the previous filler has dissolved can result in an overdone look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you dissolve fillers, you’ll need to receive injections of hyaluronidase (Hyalase) near the original filler injection site. Hyalase is a synthetic form of the enzymes in the body that degrades hyalyronic acid. When Hyalase is injected, it speeds up the filler dissolving process that otherwise would take place over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The dissolving appointment is much like the filler appointment: your injector will consult with you about your goals, apply numbing cream if necessary, and inject the hyaluronidase. Dissolving typically takes effect right away, however, each person and brand of filler is different and it could take up to a few days to reach full results. And just as with filler, side effects to dissolving include bruising and swelling.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK571qGcp2WkpHqltdKspqWulWKzqrjLnqlmb2FmfXGFkw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zeeko-zaki-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zeeko Zaki Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./topics-to-chat-with-a-girl-on-whatsapp-that-are-fun-for-both-parties.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Topics to chat with a girl on WhatsApp that are fun for both parties</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
