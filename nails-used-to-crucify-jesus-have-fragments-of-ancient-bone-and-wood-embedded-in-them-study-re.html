the Jewish priest who sent Jesus to his death in the Bible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000615734683.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000615734710.jpg><p>At some point after the cave was excavated in 1990, however, the nails went missing.</p><p>Years later, filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici claimed to have found the nails, even saying that they were used to crucify Jesus himself in the 2011 documentary, Nails Of The Cross.</p><p>At the time, scholars slammed the suggestion, denying that the nails Jacobovici had found were the same ones from Caiaphas' tomb.</p><p>But now an explosive new study has concluded that the nails are indeed the same ones - and that they were probably used to crucify someone too.</p><p>Lead author Dr Aryeh Shimron made the jaw-dropping find after comparing material from the nails with material from the tomb's ossuaries - limestone boxes used to store the bones of the dead.</p><p>He said: "The materials invading caves differ subtly from cave to cave depending on topography, soil composition in the area, the microclimate and neighbouring vegetation.</p><p>"Consequently caves have distinct physical and chemical signatures.</p><h2>CRUCIFIXION 'PROOF'</h2><p>"The physical and chemical properties of the materials which, over centuries, have invaded the tomb and its ossuaries were investigated.</p><p>"Our analysis clearly and unequivocally demonstrates that these materials are chemically and physically identical to those which have, over centuries, also become attached to the nails."</p><p>Caiaphas' cave was the only match for the nails out of 25 tombs tested, Dr Shimron found.</p><p>He continued: "We have also discovered fine slivers of wood accreted within the iron oxide rust of the nails.</p><p>"It is well preserved and entirely petrified… the wood is therefore ancient and not a chance or man-made fake attachment to the nails.</p><p>"Within the rust and sediment attached to the nails, we also identified and photographed a number of microscopic fragments of bone."</p><p>For Dr Shimron, a retired geologist who worked with Israel's Geological Survey, it's compelling evidence.</p><p>"I believe that the scientific evidence that the nails were used to crucify somebody is indeed powerful," he said.</p><p>It's also important to note that nails used in crucifixion were once considered to have powerful healing properties, and were therefore kept as amulets.</p><p>As such, the nails may have been kept by a remorseful Caiaphas, Jacobovici argues.</p><p>He further argues that the relics would have been sufficient to fix a human hand to a crossbeam - and that they may have been bent at the end to prevent a condemned man freeing himself.</p><p>Yet Dr Shimron stops short of linking the nails to Christ himself.</p><p>"The evidence that the nails were used in a crucifixion is indeed powerful," he said.</p><p>"But the only evidence we have that they were used to crucify the Jesus of the Gospels is that they were found in the tomb of Caiaphas.</p><p>"Does our evidence suffice? I really cannot say, I choose to rely on good science rather than speculation.</p><p>"Perhaps a reader of the full manuscript should rely on his or her own judgment."</p><h2>NEW BREAKTHROUGH</h2><p>The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) has always maintained that the nails in question are not from the Caiaphas tomb.</p><p>And while the authority conceded that the new study is "interesting and provides food for thought", a spokesperson said that its "unambiguous historical conclusions are somewhat problematic".</p><p>Their statement said: "It seems reasonable that the nails mentioned in the research indeed came from a cave in Jerusalem dating to the same period.</p><p>"However, a direct connection to this specific cave was not proven.</p><p>"In fact, even if a connection was found, we still cannot determine with any degree of certainty that the cave is indeed the burial place of the high priest Caiaphas.</p><p>"Questions have risen in the past concerning, for example, the cave's simplicity, which did not suit this individual's supreme social status."</p><p>Dr Shimron contends that "most archaeologists and historians, although not all, accept that the tomb is the tomb of Caiaphas the high priest".</p><p>Whatever the case, if the nails are indeed from a crucifixion, they are a remarkably rare find.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read

crucifixion, found in 1968, when archaeologists unearthed a heel bone with a nail still embedded in it.</p><p>The Caiaphas cave was discovered in Jerusalem's Peace Forest, in the south of the city, and has since been paved over.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
