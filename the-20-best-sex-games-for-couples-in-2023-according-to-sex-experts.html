Given these circumstances and the desire to keep the atmosphere light-hearted, it's easy to feel pressured into doing something one doesn't want to do. Dr. O'Reilly reminds us, however, to "always have a PASS card on hand. If the game doesn’t provide one, you can make one. Take it out at the beginning and leave it on the table knowing that you can use it—without judgment—anytime."</p><p>If a literal card isn't your style, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.marlareneestewart.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Marla Renee Stewart, MA</a>, a sexologist and sexpert for <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://loversstores.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1587397&u=1338591&m=99778&afftrack=hawk-custom-tracking&urllink=http%3A%2F%2Floversstores.com%2F" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=loversstores.com data-merchant-id=282463 data-merchant-url=loversstores.com data-merchant-network=Generic>Lovers</a>, suggests saying something like, "I don't think I'm ready for that today, but let me think about it and if we play again next month, I'll be more ready to possibly take it on.

If your partner asks you why, there’s nothing wrong with saying 'I’m just not comfortable going there but let’s keep playing.'"</p><p>And if your partner is being a bad sport? Rowntree doubles down, saying, "Don’t ever feel bad about sharing your boundaries and hard limits, because consent is key in any sexual exchange." Your partner(s) should be invested in ensuring your pleasure and comfort, and Dr. O'Reilly says that if your partner continues to coerce, guilt, or otherwise gaslight you into doing something you don't want to do, "consider focusing on the relationship itself—on your own or with a therapist who can help you to address the ways in which you communicate and support one another."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-sex-games-for-casual-partners><span>Sex Games for Casual Partners</span></h2><p>Sex games can be an excellent way of getting to know a new partner, or of capitalizing on the levity that often comes with casual and short-term relationships. "For couples who might not be familiar with each other’s preferences, games that get you asking questions are great," agrees Rowntree. "If nothing else, you get some laughs together—but really, games are a great way to learn new things about each other and explore new territory free from the inhibitions that might have prevented you from asking them to 'go there' or 'do that.'"</p><p>Below, check out some of our favorite sex games to pull out the next time you call up your casual boo.&nbsp;</p><a href=# data-model-name="Intimacy Games Sex Talk" data-url="https://intimacy.games/products/sex-talk?variant=37656168267937" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wehifgUkiTW6QUZNXcHJdJ-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Intimacy Games Sex Talk</p><p>Sex educator Tara Jones specifically recommends this product, which, per the brand, is made for partners at any and every stage, "whether you've just met or you've been together for years."</p><a href=# data-model-name="Let's Get Naked Card Game" data-url=https://www.lovehoney.com/lubes-essentials/sexy-gifts-games/adult-games/p/lets-get-naked-card-game/81215.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://lovehoneyus.sjv.io/c/221109/1243033/15309?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lovehoney.com%2Flubes-essentials%2Fsexy-gifts-games%2Fadult-games%2Fp%2Flets-get-naked-card-game%2F81215.html" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=lovehoney.com data-merchant-id=211514 data-merchant-url=lovehoney.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nfa5N2oobuPzgUAXhna9dn-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Let's Get Naked Card Game</p><p>"Silly, funny games are great for groups or newer couples who want to ease the tension and enjoy the ride," says Dr. O'Reilly.

For example, an instance where you weren’t horny before kissing but now that you and your partner are making out, you’re in the mood. In long term relationships, responsive desire becomes more and more common, and without random bouts of horniness, there needs to be more of an effort to remember to initiate sex at all. Proposing playing a sex game is a thoughtful way of letting your partner know you’re still interested in them sexually, even if you don’t randomly jump their bones."</p><p>Stewart agrees, referencing three primary benefits for couples engaging in sex games: "They help you to spend quality time together and get to know each other in a different way;" they release hormones that help you "chemically and emotionally bond with your lover'" and those increased bonds "facilitate you into being more physical with your lover."</p><a href=# data-model-name="Lovehoney Oh!

For that reason, Jones finds sex games to be a great way of prolonging anticipation.</p><p>"Foreplay is all about delayed satisfaction, and that anticipation can be so sexy when you view it as a crucial ingredient in the sexual interaction instead of something to be rushed through," she says. "Anticipation lives in the excitement phase of the sexual response cycle, the first stage preceding orgasm. It’s the key to breaking out of a routine, which in the context of sex tends to be all about getting to the goal (or climax) as fast as possible. Instead, we want to slow it down, and savor each moment. Games can be a great way to do that!"</p><a href=# data-model-name="Lovers Sex Candy & Foreplay Activities" data-url=https://loversstores.com/products/sex-candy-foreplay-activities referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1587397&u=1338591&m=99778&afftrack=hawk-custom-tracking&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Floversstores.com%2Fproducts%2Fsex-candy-foreplay-activities" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=loversstores.com data-merchant-id=282463 data-merchant-url=loversstores.com data-merchant-network=Generic><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ys3XRpWNFGT6U3uDP8muca-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Lovers Sex Candy & Foreplay Activities</p><p>Marla Renee Stewart says that this "is a good game for folks who like a little snack with their sex.
