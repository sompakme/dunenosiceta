He started out as a Commissioner for Finance and Planning, preceding Francis Afufu on this position and being in office from 1992 to 1993.

His inauguration took place on May 29th, 1999. He replaced Christopher Osondu as a Governor. He was the main figure in Cross River State’s political life for eight long years.

His birth state is Cross River State, which he later would become a Governor of. He was born in Calabar to Henry Etim Duke and his wife Genevieve Etim Duke. His father was a huge fan of Disney, that is why he gave his son the name Donald – after one of the characters.</p><p class=align-left>He was also the longest-serving Chairman of Nigerian Customs and the second indigenous one after Ayodele Diyan. He served there between 1967 and 1975 when the Nigerian Customs service was still called Board of Customs and Excise Duties. Basically, Donald Duke grew up in the family of high officials.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/68547b1718fd7e15.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Desmond Harrington Dexter's bio: wife, drastic weight loss, is he sick?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Donald had four siblings. He was the fourth oldest child of five in his family. He was born in the eastern part of Nigeria, but he grew up in the western part, where he received the early education. His primary education was in Corona and Saint Mary’s School, which is located in Lagos. Afterwards, he went to the Unity Schools at Sokoto and Ilorin for his secondary education. For A-levels, he came back to Lagos to study at the Federal School of Arts and Science.</p><p class=align-left>Donald Duke successfully passed his exams and received invitations to the most prestigious universities. In 1982, he received the Bachelor degree at the Ahmadu Bello University. He decided to continue his education in 1983 by going to the Nigerian Law School in Lagos. In 1984, he got the Master’s degree in Business Law and Admiralty at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States.</p><p class=align-left>The young man has received a great education abroad, along with sufficient exposure and serious business and law practice. After his United States ventures, Donald Duke decided to come back to Nigeria. He created a team with some of his colleagues, and together they established a partnership “Oniya & Duke”, based in Lagos. He became a great professional in law, and he began fully managed the family business in shipping when he got the position of CEO at the Hegeds International Limited.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e0d8474b5afb7606.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top facts you should know about the famous British actor and model Jaye Davidson</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 1991, Donald Duke made a decision to start working on his political career. He first took an active part in Nigeria’s political life when he got appointed to be a member of the Board of Directors in Voice of Nigeria. Later, in 1992, as a result of good work, he got another appointment – he received a position of a Commissioner for Finance, Budget, and Planning from the Governor Clement D.Ebri. This appointment was fruitful but also quite short-lived because of the abrupt Government change at the end of 1993. After he was forced to step away from his position, Donald Duke went back to his private life and got a position of a chairman of the company called Allied Merchants and Brokers Limited.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Reasons for political apathy in Nigeria</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3cmipffka88.jpg><h2>Governor Donald Duke and his work</h2><p class=align-left>As the time passed, Donald Duke decided to return to political life, running for the Governor of Cross River State position in 1999. In the end, he was chosen to become a Governor, officially stepping into his rank on May 29th of the same year. He advocated for democracy and against the military control, stating that the military got out of power not by democracy, but by the horrible economic state. He added that if democratic government is unable to deliver food and means of survival for thousands of people, then the democracy can be forgotten about.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fcba4599c6f243c5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Troy Gentile biography: Everything you need to know about the young actor</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Governor Donald Duke received a lot of praise for his social work, such as contribution to urban development, environment, agriculture, communication, information, and governance, as well as tourism and unit investment. He made a lot of effort for his native city Calabar, and to this day, it holds the unofficial title of the “cleanest city in entire Nigeria”. Donald Duke was an initiator of Calabar Carnival, which has started in 2004 and since then has become the biggest street party in Africa. It was also his idea to organize the Obudu Ranch International Mountain race. It has become one of the most popular and lucrative competitions of this kind in the world.</p><p class=align-left>This leader also created a fund of reserves for the state, which was supposed to insure the inhabitants of Cross River State from the economic struggles and inevitable rainy days. He became an initiator of Tinapa Resort project, which was his plan to boost the development of tourism and business in Cross River State. It was reported that almost 350 million dollars were spent on the primary development of the resort, before the first phase was opened in April 2007. As it was reported by BBC, Governor Donald Duke became the only governor of Nigeria, who was specifically mentioned not to be investigated for the financial crimes. There were four more governors who were not investigated, but unlike Donald Duke’s, their names were not specified.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1a4cf0862a5eb44c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>General Sani Abacha: who really was this man?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Donald Duke had plans to run for President in the 2007 election.

He said that he is actively discussing this possibility with his fellow party members, who support his ambitions. Even though he is friendly with the former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, Donald Duke said that he did not influence his decision to become the President of Nigeria, and it was totally personal. He also clarified that he would not be supported financially by Obasanjo in any way. Donald Duke is hoping that he is able to make the lives of Nigerians better and save the economy of the country. We will see if he succeeds in the Presidential run in 2019.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2ghf1so8jon.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is the name of the youngest president in Africa?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Cross River State government: Donald Duke said that he would contest for the presidency in the 2019</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/68547b1718fd7e15.png><h2>Donald Duke's wife</h2><p class=align-left>Donald Duke is also a huge family man.

Donald was a year ahead of Onari, and he met her while campaigning for the elections to the student union.

Before they started dating, they were friends for about six years. No matter how many years have passed, Donald Duke and his wife are still a happy and loving couple who always remembers about all of their anniversaries.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/515c6aeb62612f49.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Peter Obi's biography and career: his rise to fame revealed</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Onari Duke has a successful career.

She has two daughters with her husband, and she made a decision that she will not hire a nanny to help her children with homework. She was always trying her best to spend as much time as she can with them.
