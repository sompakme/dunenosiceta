Sweet Brown’s tagline ‘Ain’t nobody got time for that’ resounded throughout the humorous video, and it quickly became a viral hit on the internet.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>In regards to this, who claimed that nobody has time for such things?</h3><p>That’s not something anybody has time for. There is a popular YouTube video showing Kimberly “Sweet Brown” Wilkins being interviewed after escaping a fire in an apartment building. The video has gained widespread attention. It first broadcast on KFOR-TV, an NBC station in Oklahoma City, on April 8, 2012 at 8:00 p.m.</p><p>As a result, the issue arises as to what exactly “ain’t nobody got time for that” means. “Nobody has the time for it!” it implies. The remark became well-known as a result of its frequent use in the aforementioned television programme.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Furthermore, is the song “Ain’t nobody had time for that” protected by copyright?</h3><p>“Sweet Brown, a viral video celebrity, is suing Apple for alleged copyright violation.”</p><p>In a lawsuit filed against Apple Inc., an Oklahoma lady who gained Internet popularity with the tagline “Ain’t nobody got time for that!” claims the company did not have authorization to profit from a musical mashup of her wacky television appearance.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the estimated net worth of Sweet Brown?</h3><p>Inheritance and Earnings She has amassed a substantial amount of riches as a result of her online celebrity. Even though we were unable to locate the actual statistics of her earnings, we estimate that her net worth is in the neighbourhood of $2 million.</p><p></p><h3>What exactly is cold pop?</h3><p>Anything from a vending machine or ice chest that is cold to the touch, delicious, and very satisfying when you wake up at 3:30 a.m. to the smell of neighbours barbecuing at your apartment complex, only to discover that “oh, lord jesus – it’s a fire” and you have to flee for your life, forgetting your shoes and everything else</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>So, what did Sweet Brown have to say?</h3><p>I said, “Oh my God, there’s a fire.” Then I went out the door, I didn’t grab any shoes or anything, I just fled for my life, as Jesus would say. And then the smoke got the better of me, and I ended up with bronchitis, which nobody has time for.</p><p></p><h3>What is the whole meaning of the word Ain’t?</h3><p>This information comes from Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia. In the common English language vernacular, the phrase ain’t is a contraction for the words am not, is not, are not, has not, and have not, as well as for the words am not, is not, are not, and have not. In various dialects, the word ain’t is also used as a contraction of the words do not, does not, and did not, among other things.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6hprBlnaqwqXnMqKWesV2ZtqV5wKKlrWWepK%2BwsNhmnqisXam2rrGMn6arZaSdrrV6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marc-anthony-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marc Anthony Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hard-rock-nick-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hard Rock Nick Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
