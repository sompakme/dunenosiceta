They're quick and can offer some candidates visibly noticeable results with zero recovery time (so you can proceed with your day as normal immediately after the procedure). But the innovation doesn't stop there. While most current body contouring devices are either designed to only tone muscle or burn fat during a session, the newest one to hit the aesthetics scene on Oct. 17 offers both in one single treatment. Meet, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://bodybybtl.com/solutions/emsculpt-neo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emsculpt Neo" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Emsculpt Neo</a>.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=1 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How Does Emsculpt Neo Work?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Emsculpt Neo is the first-ever machine to combine two body-contouring procedures—fat removal and muscle toning—into a single non-surgical treatment that takes about 30 minutes to complete. Its muscle toning claim is based on the same technology that the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JOuCUKvJ4w" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="original Emsculpt" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">original Emsculpt</a> became famous and beloved for: high-intensity focused electromagnetic energy. “Emsculpt uses the electromagnetic energy to stimulate high frequency and intense muscle contractions at the nerve root,” says Paul Jarrod Frank, MD, a celebrity cosmetic dermatologist in New York City.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“[Radiofrequency heating] is a permanent form of fat loss.” – Melanie Palm, MD <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This deep stimulation allows the treatment “to challenge muscle contraction and development in a manner that is not possible through mere voluntary exercise,” Dr. Frank explains. Just one treatment triggers about <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JOuCUKvJ4w" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="20,000 muscle contractions" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">20,000 muscle contractions</a>, according to the brand.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The difference between Emsculpt Neo and its predecessor is the introduction of radiofrequency heating, intended to induce fat reduction. “Radiofrequency is basically just a very sophisticated form of electricity that creates bulk heating of tissues,” says Melanie Palm, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in San Diego, California. “When you heat the tissue, a certain percentage of the fat cells become unhappy and undergo controlled cell death–so it’s a permanent form of fat loss.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The brand explains that the excess fat cells are destroyed and eventually eliminated via your body's natural processes. The process has been <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K192224.pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="clinically shown" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">clinically shown</a> to take about one month, with optimal results potentially appearing in about three months.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What Does Emsculpt Neo Actually Feel Like?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While undergoing two treatments at once may seem like a lot to handle, dermatologists say that the treatment is not only bearable, but actually quite enjoyable. “I don’t think either of them are uncomfortable, they are just interesting sensations,” says Dr. Palm, who has personally tried the Emsculpt Neo. “I think having the heat makes the contractions easier and warming up the muscles allows us to get a more effective treatment, so they’re very synergistic.”</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What Results Can Patients Expect?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As many Emsculpt customers have discovered in the two years since its original launch, the technology is reliably effective. A clinical trial presented at the annual meeting of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.asds.net/medical-professionals/annual-meeting data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Society for Dermatologic Surgery" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">American Society for Dermatologic Surgery</a> showed that Emsculpt produced a 25 percent boost in muscle mass and a 30 percent reduction of fat among 40 of the 48 people who trialed the treatment over three months.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The brand found that Emsculpt Neo’s fat reduction capabilities exceeds that of other popular body-sculpting technologies like cryolipolysis, which only reduces fat by about 22.4 percent (an average that Emsculpt derived from nine independent clinical studies that took place between 2009 and 2014). This means Emsculpt Neo—with its ability to produce results across most body types—has the potential to ultimately save you money that you would spend on other popular treatments.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Currently, the Emsculpt Neo device is FDA approved for use on the abs, arms, calves, and glutes (the same areas as the original Emsculpt). You can get the treatment done at various <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://bodybybtl.com/find-a-provider/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dermatology, plastic surgery, and laser centers" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">dermatology, plastic surgery, and laser centers</a> in the US. The brand recommends four treatments that last up to 30 minutes, spaced five to 10 days apart. Each session will cost between $850 to $1250 (it depends on the region you plan to get it), but remember—you're being treated by two types of body-contouring technologies in one sitting.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How Does One Maintain Results from Emsculpt Neo?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After completing the recommended four treatment sessions, patients who want to maximize results should keep a few things in mind. “Diet and exercise is always the essential maintenance component of any muscle stimulation and/or fat removal treatment,” Dr. Frank says. He explains that a healthy lifestyle and exercise regimen during and after treatment may not only produce more noticeable results, but it may also ensure that your results last indefinitely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZpprZGiCeX2Xbmapqp%2BoeqbEz6WYoqZdmrq0r9Slp61lnpq8cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./farfetch-promo-codes-15-off-in-july-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>FARFETCH promo codes - 15% OFF in July 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dan-majerle-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dan Majerle Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
