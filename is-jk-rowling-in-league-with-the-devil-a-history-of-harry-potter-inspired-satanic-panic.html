When she began working on the Potter series, she was a regular worshipper at Church of Scotland services; she now worships at the Scottish Episcopal Church, the official Anglican church in Scotland.</p><p>Nor is religious disdain for Harry Potter restricted to Christians in the West. The series, for instance, has been banned from schools in the United Arab Emirates since 2002, on the grounds that its values are un-Islamic.</p><p>Similar bans have been enforced in Malaysia, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia – the last of which <a href=#>has trained</a> its religious police in fighting “witchcraft”, a crime punishable by execution.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Harry Potter author JK Rowling with her minions</span></figure><p>Below is a guide to how Harry Potter has bewitched, bothered and bewildered religious authorities for the last 20 years.</p><h4>1997 to 1998 – enter a young wizard&nbsp;</h4><p>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, the first novel in the series, is published in Britain on June 26 1997. The novel wins moderate acclaim, but sells well – and will remain a best-seller for another four years.</p><p>A sequel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is published in Britain a year later, on July 2 1998. It receives similar critical and commercial success to its predecessor, the sales of which it helps to boost.</p><p>Two months later, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is published in America on September 1, with the alternative title – the only re-titled book in the series – of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.</p><p>The publishers Scholastic reputedly believed that Americans wouldn’t have associated “philosopher” with magic, and the book would have been overlooked.</p><h4>1999 – the first&nbsp;complaints roll in</h4><p>Chamber of Secrets is published in America on June 2. The third volume, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, appears in Britain on July 8, and reaches America more swiftly, thanks to the series’ burgeoning popularity, on September 8. (All subsequent instalments will be published at the same time worldwide.)</p><p>The first American controversy arises in Simi Valley, California, where a parent named Cynthia Kersey complains about the use of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone in the classroom. Kersey calls the novel “violent”, “anti-family”, and (intriguingly) says that it “has a religious theme”.</p><p>A committee of parents, teachers and officials decide to allow the reading aloud of Rowling’s novel, but not to make it required reading at any level, and to permit parents to withdraw their children when the novel is being read.</p><p>Kersey is unhappy. “I think it’s pathetic that the school district is afraid to make a moral decision.” A similar dispute follows within days in Frankfort, Illinois, and has an identical result.</p><p>Weeks later, in December, Bruckner Elementary School in Saginaw, Michigan becomes the first American school to ban the books. The school principal, Myra Fall, accedes to a request from Kathryn MacGown.&nbsp;</p><p>“The books are based on sorcery, which is an abomination to the Lord”, MacGown says. “I read a couple of chapters and felt like God didn’t want me reading it.”</p><h4>2000 – book burnings, ‘black magic’ and British bans</h4><p>On March 29, a book burning is conducted at the Harvest Assembly of God Church in rural Pennsylvania. The Rev George Bender includes the three Harry Potter novels, branding them “ungodly”. (“We got some people mad at us,” he adds, “but it’s good to have publicity.”)</p><p>In July, production on the first Harry Potter film begins in Britain. Location scouts ask to use Canterbury Cathedral but <a href=#>are turned down</a>.</p><p>A spokesman for the Dean, Robert Willis, explains that the cathedral authorities “did not think the books posed problems. But other people might take offence and so we had to say no.”</p><p>Gloucester Cathedral steps in. The Dean, the Very Rev Nicholas Bury, says that in Rowling’s books, “goodness, honesty and integrity overcome lies and deceit”.&nbsp;</p><p>He adds: “I believe the books are likely to become classic children’s stories in the great tradition of CS Lewis’s Narnia stories and JRR Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings.”</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Gloucester Cathedral demurred from being a filming location for the Harry Potter series</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Lonely Planet/John Freeman</span></figure><p>On July 8, the fourth novel, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, is published. Soon after, St Mary’s Island Primary School, a Church of England school in Chatham, Kent, <a href=#>becomes</a> what is believed to be the first British school to ban the Potter series.</p><p>The headmistress, Carol Rookwood, explains her decision by saying that Rowling’s series fails to conform to the school’s “church ethos”.</p><p>“The Bible,” she adds, “is very clear and consistent in its teachings that wizards, devils and demons exist, and are very real, powerful and dangerous, and God’s people are told to have nothing to do with them.”</p><p>By the end of the year, at least 10 further disputes have arisen in America. The majority end with compromises similar to those in Simi Valley and Frankfort. One exception is the committee in Whittier, California; when 53 parents complain about the novels’ “black magic”, it refuses, pointing out that the tales of the Brothers Grimm would have to be banned as well.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Carrollwood Elementary School in Florida pre-emptively removes the entire series, despite having received no complaints. The principal, Joan Bookman, says: “We just knew that we had some parents who wouldn’t want their children to read these books.”</p><p>For the 1990–2000 period ends, the four Harry Potter novels are ranked as the seventh-most-protested books in America, despite their only being available for a year and a half.</p><h4>2001 – toy-shops and teachers say no</h4><p>In September, one of Britain’s largest toy shops <a href=#>announces</a> that it will not stock Harry Potter merchandise. Gary Grant, owner of the retail chain&nbsp;The Entertainer, bans the toys from all 28 of his stores across the country.</p><p>“I am not happy to turn what is good reading into role-play,”&nbsp;he says.&nbsp;“My concern is that children start off with something quite innocent which can get out of hand. As a parent I do not want them drawn into ouija boards and the occult.”</p><p>(As of 2019, The Entertainer, which now has 163 stores, continues neither to open on Sundays nor to stock Potter toys.)</p><p>In November, the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, is released. Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, it eventually makes $975 million worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p>This sets a remarkably stable trend: each of the eight films will have a budget of between $100 million and $250 million, and each will make between $800 million and $1 billion. (The exception is the final film, Deathly Hallows – Part 2, which will make $1.3 billion.)</p><p>In the wake of the film’s success, a second British school <a href=#>restricts</a> the presence of Harry Potter in the classroom. Wendy Pearson, a teacher at Haydn Primary School in Sherwood, cites parents’ complaints that “reading the book could lead to children dabbling in spells and witchcraft.”</p><p>A spokesman for the local authority says that the decision is a matter for the school; a spokesman for the school, in turn, says that it’s up to individual teachers.</p><p>(By now, the novels are banned in American school districts in Kansas, Pennsylvania, Wyoming and Illinois. A steady trickle of interdictions across the country will continue for the next decade and a half, with the latest being this week’s news (above) from Tennessee.)</p><p>In December, a second Potter book-burning is conducted at Christ Community Church in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Pastor Jack Brock delivers a long sermon in which he denounces Rowling’s series.</p><p>“Behind that innocent face,” he says, “is the power of satanic darkness. Harry Potter is the devil and he is destroying people.” Brock avows never to have read the books himself, but to have “researched” them.</p><p>In the years since, there have been at least another four public burnings of Harry Potter books in America.</p><p>As the year ends, work on the second film, Chamber of Secrets, is well under way.</p><h4>2002 – the UAE cracks down</h4><p>The United Arab Emirates <a href=#>bans the Potter series</a> from schools nationwide. Expatriate schools, which are required to submit textbooks to the Ministry of Education and Youth for approval, are informed privately that the novels are “contrary to Islamic values”.</p><p>Twenty-five other books, including Orwell’s Animal Farm, are concurrently banned in the UAE.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Stanislav Ianevski (far left), at a 2005 photocall for Goblet of Fire; his casting was protested by Bulgarian church authorities</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Toby Melville/Reuters</span></figure><h4>2003 to 2004 – the campaign moves East</h4><p>In January 2003, a Russian woman files a legal suit against the Russian translators of the Potter series, alleging that the books “instil religious extremism and prompt students to join religious organisations with Satanist followers”. A prosecutor concludes that there is no case to answer.</p><p>Book five, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, is published on June 21.</p><p>This is the first year in which Harry Potter books are the “most-challenged” books in American schools. They&nbsp;drop off the list entirely a year later.</p><p>In 2004, after the Bulgarian actor Stanislav Ianevski is cast as Viktor Krum in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church issues a statement saying that “magic is not a children’s game”. It also begins a pamphleting campaign in the capital Sofia, reminding citizens that “God hates magic” and that reading Rowling’s novels is like “praying to evil”.</p><h4>2005 – condemnation from the Pope</h4><p>Book six, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, is published on July 16. In a sign of the Potter series’s cultural hegemony, despite the opposition, within 24 hours a total of 9 million copies have been sold worldwide.</p><p>In July, a pair of letters by the new Pope, Benedict XVI, are made public, in which he criticises Rowling’s books.&nbsp;</p><p>Responding in 2003 to a German religious author who opposes the Potter novels, the former cardinal and Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith – the body in charge of protecting Catholic doctrine – declares it “good that you enlighten people about Harry Potter”.</p><p>Benedict attributes to Rowling’s work “subtle seductions” that “act unnoticed, and by this deeply distort Christianity in the soul before it can grow properly”. As Pope, however, he will express no further opinion on the Harry Potter books.</p><p>At the year’s end, the American Library Association ranks the Potter series top of their list of “Most Challenged Books of the 21st Century” to date.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Benedict XVI, who before his pontificate had voiced opposition to Harry Potter, seen here in 2013</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: AFP</span></figure><h4>2007 – welcome to the ‘Order of Darkness’</h4><p>The seventh and final book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, is published on July 21. It breaks the record set by Half-Blood Prince, selling over 11 million copies in the first 24 hours.</p><p>When the fifth film, Order of the Phoenix, is released on July 11, an intense debate begins in the Catholic Church about the morality of the novels and films. The Church itself maintains no official position.</p><p>The fiercest opposition is represented by a Traditionalist group in France, who soon <a href=#>publish</a> a book-length missive titled Harry Potter et “L’Ordre des Ténèbres”: Dénonciation chrétienne d'un phénomène sans précédent (Harry Potter and the Order of Darkness: A Christian Denunciation of a Phenomenon Without Precedent).&nbsp;</p><p>L’Osservatore Romano, the Vatican’s official newspaper, dedicates a page to the subject in its January 15 2008 issue; both pro- and anti-Harry Potter views are represented.</p><h4>2009 – Satanic accusations, American reproofs</h4><p>On January 31, Rev Gerhard Maria Wagner, a highly conservative Austrian priest, <a href=#>is promoted</a> to auxiliary bishop of Linz by Benedict XVI. Wagner has previously said that the Potter novels encourage “Satanism”.&nbsp;</p><p>Wagner then resigns on February 15, after remarks from 2005 surface in which he attributes Hurricane Katrina to “divine retribution” for the toleration of homosexuality in America.</p><p>On July 15, the sixth film, Order of the Phoenix, is released. This time, L’Osservatore Romano is <a href=#>effusive in its praise</a>: “There is a clear line of demarcation between good and evil, and [the film] makes clear that good is right.” The newspaper rates the film “appropriate for adults and adolescents”.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>George W Bush's administration allegedly refused JK Rowling a Presidential Medal of Freedom on religious grounds</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Shawn Thew/EPA</span></figure><p>Meanwhile, in America, a new book by George W Bush’s former speechwriter <a href=#>alleges </a>that Rowling was denied a Presidential Medal of Freedom by the Bush administration over religious concerns.</p><p>Matt Latimer writes that key “people in the White House” during the 2001–9 administration thought that “the Harry Potter books encouraged witchcraft”.</p><h4>2011 – the saga concludes</h4><p>On July 15, the final film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, is released. This concludes the release of all seven novels and all eight films. The films have collectively grossed $7.7 billion, and over 500 million books have been sold.&nbsp;</p><p>By 2014, Rowling will become the first author to make over £1 billion from her work, though she will subsequently donate much of her wealth to charity.</p><h4>2012 – Hermione goes&nbsp;to church</h4><p>Fifteen years after the first book appeared, Medowie Christian School in New South Wales, Australia, makes fresh headlines by belatedly banning the series. The novels, school authorities say, promote “un-Christian values”. The decision attracts widespread derision.</p><p>Meanwhile, in <a href=#>an interview</a> with The Sun, Emma Watson reveals that while she played Hermione Granger on screen, she was constantly subject to religious attention.&nbsp;</p><p>“Finding [the] films un-Christian, people think I need to be guided and send me The Bible," she says. "I now have a collection of 20.”</p><h4>2015 – British disapproval on the rise?</h4><p>Tom Bennett, the British government’s educational behaviour tsar, <a href=#>reveals</a> that in spite of the lack of official religious opposition, parents are continuing to protest the presence of Harry Potter in the classroom.</p><p>“Harry Potter deals with the occult,” he said at an event in London’s City Hall. “There are many parents who are uncomfortable with their children discussing or looking at or reading anything at all to do with the occult.</p><p>“For many parents, particularly of evangelical Christian backgrounds and sometimes of some Muslim backgrounds, the occult is not something which exists in fiction and fantasy, the occult is something which is a live part of their faith.”</p><p>The National Association of Head Teachers responds that “if there are grounds for a parent to not want [a book] taught (i.e. religious grounds) the teacher should be flexible in delivering their content.”</p><h4>2019&nbsp;– exorcised from Tennessee&nbsp;</h4><p>Earlier this week, following the advice of “several exorcists”, St Edward Catholic School in Nashville removes the Harry Potter books from its library.</p><p>In a letter to parents, Rev Dan Reehil writes:&nbsp;“These books present magic as both good and evil, which is not true, but in fact a clever deception.</p><p>“The curses and spells used in the books are actual curses and spells,&nbsp;which, when read by a human being, risk conjuring evil spirits into the presence of the person reading the text.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJqfpLi0e82erqxnmqB6s7vWpaCnn12hsqKz1J5knZ2mnrlutMisq6iqqWK1or7RsmSpp6SpsrN5yKeqqaGimrFuv8CtmKehk2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kennedy-leigh-age-wikipedia-biography-height-weight-net-worth-in-2021-and-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kennedy Leigh Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Height, Weight, Net Worth in 2021 and more</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-it-rude-to-wear-black-to-a-wedding.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is it rude to wear black to a wedding?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
