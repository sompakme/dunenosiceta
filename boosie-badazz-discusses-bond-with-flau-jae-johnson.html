The LSU freshman played an important role in the team's first-ever National Championship. However, Johnson is also a rapper. Performing under the stage name Flau'jae, Johnson previously appeared on The Rap Game and America's Got Talent. However, she has since signed with Roc Nation and is prepping collabs with a number of artists. But she also shares a deep connection with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Boosie Badazz</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I was cool with her dad," Boosie explained, referring to rapper Camoflauge. "All through her life, I've been there. She calls me uncle. She been playing in my backyard since she was little." Furthermore, the rapper couldn't help but smile as Vlad asked him how it felt to see Johnson win a National Championship earlier this year. "It made me proud. It got me emotional, it made me proud. I saw it. I saw it coming. When she was about going to LSU...I'm just happy for her. I know her daddy looking down on her, happy for her."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Camoflague, born Jason Johnson, was a close friend of Boosie's. However, he was tragically killed in Savannah, Georgia at the age of 21 in 2003. Flau'jae was born a little under six months later. In her own interview on VladTV, she spoke about everything that Boosie had done to help her over the years. "He showed love, even helping me get on The Rap Game, tried to help me navigate as much as he could. He got a lotta kids so for him to even reach his hand out, to take the time to do that, that was a lotta love."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbYV1hJVmmaino56ybq7AnZizsl2buaLByZqcZqKfnbu0u81mnZqlmaHGbr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z3iWp5mknsOmq8CdqnZp</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cody-longo-net-worth-earnings-the-rich-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cody Longo Net Worth: Earnings &amp;amp; The Rich Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./benefit-gimmie-brow-eyebrow-gel-is-50-off.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Benefit Gimmie Brow Eyebrow Gel Is 50% Off</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
