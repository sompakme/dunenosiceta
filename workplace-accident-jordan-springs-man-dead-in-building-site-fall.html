He then tripped over and has fallen down the shaft,” he said.</p><p>Multiple emergency crews, including a Care Flight helicopter, rushed to the scene after receiving frantic calls from Mr Riche’s co-workers.</p><p>“(But) when we arrived, we found that he had fallen several floors through a void in the ceiling, like a service void of a lift well,” NSW Ambulance Inspector Craig Thomas told news.com.au.</p><p>“It was a direct fall of approximately seven floors onto the concrete below.</p><p>“The specialist paramedics set up an abseiling rope to gain access and … to go down and confirm whether or not he had passed away.”</p><p>Inspector Thomas said the man suffered fatal injuries that he couldn’t have recovered from.</p><p>“There was damage to various parts of his body,” he said.</p><p>The inspector described the situation as a “quite an emotional scene”.</p><p>“There was quite a large number of construction workers up here, there was a bit of a language barrier and they were obviously quite concerned about his welfare,” he said.</p><p>The workers were “quite upset” when they were told by authorities their colleague had died. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> reports the man’s workmates refused to leave until his body had been retrieved.</p><p>“He’s come to work and he’s not going home,” Inspector Thomas said.</p><p>“It’s the hardest part, I suppose, what looks to be an avoidable incident and he’s not going to be going home to whatever family he’s got.</p><p>“It is an avoidable type of incident. It is just a real tragedy.”</p><p>A report will be prepared for the coroner following the construction site death.</p><p>“There are no suspicious circumstances and police are working in conjunction with SafeWork NSW,” the police force said in a statement this afternoon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwutKwZJqbpGSubsPOq6Keql2ewG6uxKWgnq6VmXq1u4yhmK%2BdXZuurbjEp2Ssnaaav6K4jJ%2BjqKeiqHqiwIyaZJutmaGxqrrGZqqirJVitq95yaipnZmeYsCxvsinnqxlmaN6uLHSrZyrpl2oxqW6xLJmp52nqHq0wM6rsGhukpmGd3%2FAcp1vbGVugKZ8kZ2Zb55km654sJefbmlpYA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./survivor-ghost-island-donathan-hurley-preseason-interview.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Survivor: Ghost Island': Donathan Hurley Preseason Interview</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-makes-a-good-apology.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What makes a good apology?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
