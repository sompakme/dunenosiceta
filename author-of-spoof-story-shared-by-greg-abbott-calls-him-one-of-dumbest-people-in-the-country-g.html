Abbott</a>, is among the “dumbest people in the country” after Abbott shared a fake article about his own state.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The Maine resident Christopher Blair, who runs the satirical website Dunning-Kruger-Times, ridiculed Abbott after the governor <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">shared a fake article</a> about country singer Garth Brooks being booed off a stage over his support of Bud Light.</p><figure id=935a6f35-076a-4b1f-85c7-7aae3b8746b2 data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement

myself with joy,” Blair said in an interview with the Guardian.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“He’s one of the dumbest people in the country.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>On 25 June, Abbott responded to a story about Brooks being jeered by “patriots” over his calls for tolerance at the 123rd annual <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Texas</a> Country Jamboree in the city of Hambriston.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>But Hambriston is not a real city. The jamboree is also not a real event. The entire article was false, one of many written by Blair under the alias “Flagg Eagleton”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair said that at one point he feared that it would be too obvious the article was fake. “As soon as I wrote the headline, I said to myself that it might be a little bit much,” Blair said. “But it wasn’t.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Abbott still genuinely responded to the fake article from his personal Twitter account. “Go Woke. Go Broke,” Abbott wrote about the false story.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Garth called his conservative fans assholes. Good job, Texas,” Abbott added, referring to the booing.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Abbott quickly deleted the tweet. But several Twitter users took screenshots of the gaffe and mocked Abbott.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Way to go governor Abbott!” <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">wrote</a> one Twitter user. Another user <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">called</a> Abbott a “sucker” for being fooled by the article.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Abbott’s office could not be reached by the Guardian for comment.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Republicans have denounced Brooks after he <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">announced</a> that his Nashville bar would serve Bud Light beer and encouraged his customers to be tolerant.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Far-right and anti-trans figures have <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">criticized</a> the beer brand for working with the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney</a> for a promotion during the annual March Madness national college basketball tournament.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair said Abbott is not the first public official to share false articles written by himself or other satirical writers.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner, has also reposted a Dunning-Kruger-Times article.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Miller responded to a false article about Kyle Rittenhouse taking out a lien against the actor Whoopi Goldberg’s house. “She refuses to pay. He’s within his rights. He seems to be very good at that,” Miller wrote on Facebook, according to a screenshot shared by Blair.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair has run America’s Last Line of Defense (Allod), which operates the Dunning-Kruger-Times and other satirical websites, since 2016, when Donald Trump was elected US president.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair, who self-identifies as a “professional liberal troll”, said the goal of the website was to expose the “gullibility of rightwing extremists”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Before this “operation”, Blair received attention for hijacking a conservative Facebook page and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">posting pictures of goats</a> as the online liberal personality “Busta Troll”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Fake articles created by Blair and other Allod affiliates usually cover topics associated with conservatives’ culture war, including Garth Brooks and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the M&M candy controversy</a>.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“They get so riled up over nothing,” Blair said of the conservatives who reshare his article. “Right now, they’re at war with Garth Brooks. He doesn’t care.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair added that much of the focus on cultural issues among conservatives “comes from the top in the conservative world”, from figures like Tucker Carlson.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Anything to take away from what’s happening to Trump,” Blair said. “Anything to take away from what the Republican party is doing in general. Anything to take away from the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">corruption in the supreme court</a>.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair says he has received criticism from people who say that he is propagating misinformation, but contends that the site openly advertises as being false.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The Dunning-Kruger-Times.com website reads: “Dunning-Kruger-Times.com is a subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery, or as Snopes called it before they lost their war on satire: Junk News.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“At the end of the day, somebody is telling them that this is fake,” Blair said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Blair said it was “disappointing” to see public officials share articles that are clearly fake. “I shake my head. To see it shared by people who matter, I shake my head and I chuckle,” Blair said. “It’s really disappointing to see so many people over the years who have just been dumb enough. Greg Abbott, especially.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK2jYrumw9JoaWlqY2S3triOam5on6KatG6twZumraxdqL2wu8Vmqq2noq56qK3RrZ9mmqKkvKy%2FjJqsraCfp3qlwcyb</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./becky-stanley-where-is-charles-stanley-s-daughter-today.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Becky Stanley: where is Charles Stanley's daughter today?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./he-has-finished-waec-nigerian-mother-angry-as-her-son-braids-his-hair-all-back-after-wassce.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;He Has Finished WAEC&amp;quot;: Nigerian Mother Angry As Her Son Braids His Hair All Back After WASSCE</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
