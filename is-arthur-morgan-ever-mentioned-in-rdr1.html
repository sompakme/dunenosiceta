The events of Red Dead Redemption 1 take place in 1911, after Arthur’s death in 1899. Additionally, the characters in RDR1 do not mention Arthur as it may be too painful for them to recall memories of him.</p><h3>1. Is Arthur Morgan mentioned in Red Dead Redemption 1?</h3><p>No, he died in 1899. Red Dead Redemption 1 takes place in 1911. Plus, his grave site is not in the first game because the new locations were not accessible to players of the first game.</p><h3>2. Does John wear Arthur’s hat in RDR1?</h3><p>No, John does not wear Arthur’s hat in Red Dead Redemption 1. While they may look similar, they are actually different hats. Arthur’s hat is made of pure leather, while John wears a Light Center Crease, Modified-Cattleman hat.</p><h3>3. Is Blackwater mentioned in RDR1?</h3><p>Yes, Blackwater is mentioned in Red Dead Redemption 1. The Blackwater massacre is referenced a few times by Mr. Ricketts in RDR1 and is also mentioned frequently in Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><h3>4. Is Hosea Matthews in RDR1?</h3><p>No, Hosea Matthews is not a character in Red Dead Redemption 1. He is a major character in Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><h3>5. Is John with Abigail in RDR1?</h3><p>Yes, John Marston is with Abigail in Red Dead Redemption 1. They are married and have a child named Jack. However, the details of their relationship and its beginnings are mostly unknown.</p><h3>6. Is Sadie mentioned in RDR1?</h3><p>No, Sadie Adler is not mentioned in Red Dead Redemption 1. She is a character introduced in Red Dead Redemption 2 and her fate is not explored in the first game.</p><h3>7. Will there be RDR3?</h3><p>While there have been hints and teases from Rockstar Games, there is no official confirmation of a third Red Dead Redemption game yet. It is likely that we will see a new installment in the future, but the release date is unknown.</p><h3>8. Why can’t John Marston swim in RDR1?</h3><p>John Marston is unable to swim in Red Dead Redemption 1 because, canonically, he never learned how to swim. This explains why jumping into a lake or river in the game can be deadly for him. Since RDR2 is a prequel to RDR1, it stands to reason that John wouldn’t know how to swim in the first game either.</p><h3>9. Is the entire RDR1 map in RDR2?</h3><p>No, the entire map of Red Dead Redemption 1 is not included in Red Dead Redemption 2. While the games share some key locations, their maps are not exact copies. RDR2’s map is more than double the size of RDR1’s map and most of RDR2’s story takes place east of the areas explored in RDR1.</p><h3>10. Who was John looking for in RDR?</h3><p>In Red Dead Redemption, John Marston is manipulated by the FBI into hunting down three surviving members of his former gang. He is tasked with finding and bringing in Bill Williamson, Javier Escuela, and Dutch Van Der Linde.</p><h3>11. Do you lose all of Arthur’s stuff when he died?</h3><p>After Arthur’s death in Red Dead Redemption 2, players will not have access to his belongings. However, in the epilogue of the game, players take control of John Marston and receive all of Arthur’s outfits and weapons, except for the horses Arthur owned.</p><h3>12. Can John swim in Red Dead?</h3><p>No, John Marston cannot swim in Red Dead Redemption. If he jumps into a lake or river, his stamina bar will deplete quickly, and he will drown. This limitation is consistent with the fact that John doesn’t know how to swim in the game’s canon.</p><h3>13. What year is RDR1 set?</h3><p>Red Dead Redemption 1 is set in the year 1911 in a fictionalized representation of the United States. The game follows the story of John Marston, an outlaw attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries.</p><h3>14. Why does John not mention Arthur in RDR1?</h3><p>John Marston does not mention Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption 1. There could be multiple reasons for this. Firstly, it may hurt him to think of Arthur and the loss of their relationship. Secondly, John could be ashamed that Arthur sacrificed himself to save John’s family. Lastly, Arthur’s final words to John were “Don’t look back” which could be interpreted as a request to not mention him.</p><h3>15. Why did Dutch shoot Micah?</h3><p>Dutch shoots Micah Bell in Red Dead Redemption 2 because he realizes that Micah had betrayed him and the gang. The revelation of Micah’s betrayal leads Dutch</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWgmrGqrY6iqmaZoqm1tr6Mpqarn5GjeqbCxKtkpp2eqbawusSdZKKmXaexs32O</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jai-paul-performs-live-for-1st-time-ever-at-coachella.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jai Paul Performs Live For 1st Time Ever At Coachella</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./good-girl-no-dey-pay-funny-reactions-as-bobrisky-lists-tips-to-follow-to-catch-a-big-fish-in.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Good Girl No Dey Pay: Funny Reactions As Bobrisky Lists Tips to Follow to Catch a Big Fish in</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
