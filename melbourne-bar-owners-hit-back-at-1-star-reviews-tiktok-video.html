In recent days, one-star reviews have flooded in for Bar Bambi on Google.</p><p><i><b>Want to stream your news? Flash lets you stream 25+ news channels in 1 place.

In a second video, she reads out other negative reviews and includes a screenshot of a private message she appears to have sent Mr Russian on Instagram.</p><p>It reads: “absolute PIG YOU ARE.”</p><p>When approached by news.com.au, Bar Bambi’s management said it would be taking legal action against Ms Scerri and others.</p><p>“The lady in the TikTok has called Nick Russian “absolute Pig you are”.</p><p>“This matter is now in the hands of Bar Bambi lawyers who will be taking action against the person who has created the TikTok account as well as the people who have created fake google profile reviews that is an orchestrated campaign against the venue.”</p><p>Ms Scerri is not the first to criticise management for the way it responds to negative reviews.</p><p>Another patron wrote in February that the food was the “worst I’ve had in a long time”.</p><p>“$75 for a set menu of nothing … took over half an hour to get water to the table and even then one jug for 11 people.</p><p>“Would recommend to stay away. If I could give no stars, I would.”</p><p>Management wrote back: “After reviewing your other reviews, it seems as though Sizzler or Smorgys may be more suited … thank you for your review.”</p><p>To another customer who gave a three-star review and criticised the cost of the set menu, management wrote: “Sorry if $75 is beyond your budget. From the thousands of meals we do, most feedback is that of great value. I’m sure there are plenty of other venues more suited to your needs and budget.”</p><p>Bar Bambi did not respond to questions about its replies to negative reviews on Google.</p><p>Ms Scerri has been approached for comment.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Melbourne data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Melbourne</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8Wopp1noprAta3Uq5inrKNir6K%2B0miZmqpdl66urshmprCmlafAbsDHq5yarJWjeq2xxpqjZpmTqbawuoyorZ6qXaS%2FpLTErKurmaSasW6vwKanmqGXo3qiusNmq6KjpKS4bsLInZyoZ56axLR50q2mq7FfmYN1g5JtnZxqkZuzpn2Tm29wapFssHqxxJpncWlhZoM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nick-stahl-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nick Stahl Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mark-sheppard-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mark Sheppard Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
