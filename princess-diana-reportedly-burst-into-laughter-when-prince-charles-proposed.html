According to the<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=noopener> Mirror</a>, there wasn't a sweeping romantic epic surrounding Diana and Charles's courtship — in reality, the two had only met each other 13 times before they got engaged. And about that engagement, it was so unromantic that Princess Diana reportedly "burst into laughter" when it happened in, of all places, the nursery at Windsor Castle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Diana was just 19 years old when it happened. When she arrived at the castle that day, Charles told her that he had "missed her so much" and led her into the nursery of Windsor Castle. According to Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty Magazine, he chose the room "because the nursery is like a home." She spoke about the proposal during an appearance on the documentary Charles and Di: The Truth Behind Their Wedding.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Diana "burst out laughing," Seward said. "I think that was probably just her nerves. She didn't think it was the most romantic of proposals, but she had the proposal."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Diana spoke about the proposal in interviews, though she doesn't mention any sort of laughter. Instead, she said that "[Charles] said 'Do you realize that one day you'll be queen?' And I said, 'I love you so much, I love you so much.' He said, 'Whatever love means.' He said it then. So, I thought, that was great. I thought he meant it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Royal biographer Christopher Wilson added that Diana didn't expect the proposal at all, explaining that it was unromantic and felt more dutiful than anything else. Charles was 32, after all, and the entire world was waiting for him to get engaged.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Prince Charles didn't pick her up in his arms and embrace or do any of the things we might do when we propose marriage to the one that we love," he said. "He rang his mum, simply to say, 'There, I've done it now. You've asked me to get married to somebody, and I've fixed it.' What he'd done was, he'd finally found a wife."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8%2BroKeblajAbrDImqWaZ6Cntq%2BvxKyqZpyZlruiec%2BroKeblWKwqa3RpZysZaCnvLG70pqjZpqlp8C1ecinq6hlnJbCqLTTnqk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wille-garson-ethnicity-nationality-race-family-body-measurements-career.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wille Garson Ethnicity, Nationality, Race, Family, Body measurements, career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./little-girl-leaves-everyone-rolling-with-laughter-as-she-rocks-grandma-s-wig-at-home-video-trends.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Little Girl Leaves Everyone Rolling With Laughter as She Rocks Grandma's Wig at Home, Video Trends</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
