She holds a degree in communications from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Taylor has graced commercials, music videos, and television series, with appearances in shows like The Vampire Diaries and Drop Dead Diva. She also runs a lifestyle blog, The Taylored Life, where she shares insights on fashion, beauty, travel, and wellness.</p><p>Taylor initially crossed paths with Shep Rose through mutual friends in 2020, and their romantic journey began. She charmed both fans and fellow cast members with her warm personality and down-to-earth demeanor when she joined Southern Charm in its eighth season.</p><p>Her bond with Shep’s dog, affectionately nicknamed Lil Craig, was also a notable highlight. However, their love story came to an end after two years, and Taylor publicly confirmed their breakup via Instagram in July 2022, expressing mutual respect and friendship.</p><h2>Who is Taylor Ann Green’s new boyfriend?</h2><p>Taylor Ann Green has a new boyfriend named Gaston, who happens to be within the Southern Charm circle. According to Us Weekly, Gaston is the current roommate of TJ Dinch, a bartender at Leva Bonaparte’s Republic Garden & Lounge, a locale featured in the Southern Charm spinoff, Southern Hospitality. TJ is also friends with Naomie Olindo’s longtime confidant, Wilson Filogamo, who appeared on Southern Charm.</p><p>Taylor revealed that she and Gaston began talking at the end of July 2022, leading to their blossoming romance. She described him as “incredible” and praised his kindness and respect. She shared that her family approves of Gaston, underlining his family-oriented nature.</p><p>In her Instagram stories, Taylor offered more insights into Gaston.
