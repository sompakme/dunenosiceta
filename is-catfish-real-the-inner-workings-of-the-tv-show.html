It first premiered on 12 November 2012 and was hosted by Max Joseph and Nev Schulman. It's a show that brings out what's going on in online dating: the truths and the lies.</p><h2>What is the show all about?</h2><p class=align-left><i>Catfish</i> is a show that invented the term "catfishing", which means luring someone into a relationship by using fake online identities. A lot people get deceived with false social media profiles and fake pictures.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, <i>Catfish</i> helps solve the identity fraud cases of online dating by tackling the puzzles and complications of dating in a digital <a href=#>world</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/60f915eb305a9d00.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is Paranormal Activity based on a true story?

Kamie Crawford finally became the new co-host alongside Schulman after several other co-hosts did not work out.</p><h2>Is Catfish real?</h2><p class=align-left>Even though the show is about real-life experiences, there are always some small things from the show that will surprise you and leave you wondering if it is real or staged.</p><p class=align-left>After every episode and season, fans always ask themselves whether the show is real and want to experience what happens behind the scenes. There is a lot that happens that you don't see from the show.</p><p class=align-left>This includes the catfish contacting MTV, signing waivers, sending therapists to participants, and other things that happen before and after the production.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/60f915eb305a9d00.png><p class=align-left>As hard as it is to believe whether the show is real, everything is real, except that some parts have been edited for acting purposes.

From feelings and emotions to the relationships, all is real. The people on the show are not told what to say. This <a href=#>reality show </a>is created on true stories to help individuals learn the identity of the people they are dating online.</p><h2>How does the Catfish show work?</h2><p class=align-left>It is the catfish who applies for the show first and not the one being catfished, probably because they want to relieve themselves from online lies or to come clean.</p><p class=align-left>Then, the producers investigate and gather information about the lies and contact the one being catfished later. This all happens without giving any information about the catfish to the host.</p><p class=align-left>Before production, everyone signs a waiver to appear on camera. Everyone must be on board to film. Even though the waiver has been signed, it does not guarantee cooperation. Either party is free to change their mind. For example, in season 3, the episode of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cameryn and Miranda</a>, the catfish changed their mind, refused to be on camera, and appeared only on Skype.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5ba4e7782821dd0a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 best episodes of Wife Swap to relive the craziest moments</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After production ends, MTV sends therapists to talk to everyone who appears on the show. This is to make sure that no issues arise after and that everyone is taken care of when the need arises. The experience could be traumatising, and anyone needs proper mental health care.</p><h2>Is Catfish scripted?</h2><p class=align-left>As much as the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><i>Catfish</i> show</a> is too good to be true, it is not scripted. Most fans think MTV brings out situations and acts out and want you to believe it's real, but that's not true.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/79b5e1e5e2db28bb.png><p class=align-left>MTV edits the shows the way they want and has been accused of manipulating and changing some storylines for entertainment.
