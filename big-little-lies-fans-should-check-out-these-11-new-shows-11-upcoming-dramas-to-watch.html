And though Henrietta's cells helped contribute to medical breakthroughs, changing others' lives, her family reclaims their mother's story of how her cells were taken against her will for science. <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/oprah-winfrey/>Oprah Winfrey</a> shows off her acting chops once again, playing Deborah Lacks, Henrietta's daughter, who is the main subject of Skloot's story. The TV movie airs on HBO on April 22.</p><p><strong>'Sharp Objects'</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s2M8woNhdNEfE8WvA3vDQJ-1920-80.jpg><p>If you're in the mood for another dark HBO drama, the adaptation of Gillian Flynn's&nbsp;Sharp Objects&nbsp;will be just what you're looking for. Directed by&nbsp;Big Little Lies's&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hbos-sharp-objects-adds-eliza-scanlen-984594 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Jean-Marc Valle</a>, the show stars Amy Adams as Camille Preaker, a reporter newly released from a psychiatric hospital who is forced to return to her small hometown to cover the murders of two teenage girls. While reporting, Preaker begins to identify with the young victims, forcing her to relive dark times from her past.</p><p><strong>'Mary Kills People'</strong></p><p>The series that originally premiered on Canada's Global TV Network in January will now make its&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/lifetime-picks-up-doctor-assisted-938197 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>U.S. debut on Lifetime</a>&nbsp;this April.&nbsp;Mary Kills People&nbsp;focuses on Dr. Mary Harris, played by Caroline Dhavernas, who is an ER doctor by day, but illegally working at night, assisting patients who no longer have the will to live and want to die on their own terms. The show follows "Bloody Mary" as her day job and her evening work of assisted suicide become more intertwined. The series premieres on LifetimeSunday, April 23 at 10pm ET/PT.</p><p><strong>'The Handmaid's Tale'</strong></p><p>Another powerful show about women and women's rights will be the highly anticipated adaptation of Margret Atwood's 1985 novel,&nbsp;The Handmaid's Tale. Hulu's series follows the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/news/a26100/elisabeth-moss-and-alexis-bledel/?visibilityoverride>tale of a dystopian society</a>&nbsp;where women's rights are completely revoked and those who are fertile are reduced to birthing machines for those women who cannot bear children. While the plot, which is eerily relevant to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-redirect=https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/features/a25287/handmaids-tale-scary-parallels-trump-america/ data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a25287/handmaids-tale-scary-parallels-trump-america/>today's women's movements</a>, is strong enough on its own, the best thing about the adapted series is by far the phenomenal cast. Starring Elisabeth Moss as Offred, Samira Wiley as Moira, and Alexis Bledel as Ofglen, the series is sure to deliver.</p><p><strong>'Casting JonBenet'</strong></p><p>Twenty years later, the death of JonBenet Ramsey remains a mystery, and a topic of fascination. Over the course of 15 months, documentary filmmaker Kitty Green and her crew traveled to the Ramsey family hometown in Colorado, where they audition local actors as the Ramsey family. They also uncover how each person remembered and related to the infamous Ramsey family crime. The&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-redirect=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a24843/jonbenet-ramsey-netflix-documentary-clip/ data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/>haunting series</a>&nbsp;will examine how the murder of this 6-year-old girl still heavily impacts people today; it is set to stream on Netflix on April 28.</p><p><strong>'Stranger Things' (Season 2)<br></strong></p><p>Tagging along with the kids in&nbsp;BLL&nbsp;and&nbsp;Casting JonBenet&nbsp;is Eleven and her&nbsp;Stranger Things&nbsp;crew. Millie Bobbie Brown will be reprising her now iconic role and Winona Ryder will be back as concerned mother Joyce Byers. And, in addition to&nbsp;Ghostbusters&nbsp;costumes and "leggo my Eggo" commercials,&nbsp;The Goonies&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lord of the Rings&nbsp;star Sean Astin will join the cast as Bob Newby, a nerdy classmate from Joyce's high school. With a lot more sci-fi thrills to expect in the new season, the award-winning series returns to Netflix on Halloween.</p><p><strong>'Claws'<br></strong></p><p>The beauty salon sometimes serves as a place of relaxation and a safe place for women. But the standard beauty salon is getting a makeover in Niecy Nash's new TNT dark comedy,&nbsp;Claws. In the series, Nash plays Desna, a-not-so-typical South Florida hair salon owner, who claims her "money laundering days are over" in the series trailer. But from the quick montage of money, bodies on boats, and prescription pads in the show's teaser, it would seem that Desna and her salon squad are involved in way more than just manis and pedis. TNT's new show debuts in June.</p><p><strong>Follow&nbsp;</strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.facebook.com/MarieClaire/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><strong>Marie Claire on Facebook</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;for the latest celeb news, beauty tips, fascinating reads, livestream video, and more.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRopZ6vo2Suc4KSbGlompmceq21062jnmWcnrK0edKhprCrXam1osCMmqmeZaOeuqq4wKtm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./big-u-disagrees-with-wack-100-s-moves-speaks-about-not-being-able-to-reach-out.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Big U &amp;quot;Disagrees&amp;quot; With Wack 100's Moves, Speaks About Not Being Able To Reach Out</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./5-stress-free-christmas-shopping-tips-to-save-you-time-and-money.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>5 stress-free Christmas shopping tips to save you time and money</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./things-fall-apart-shopping-list-made-in-1984-shows-how-n100-was-used-to-buy-20-food-items-photo.html>&amp;quot;Things Fall Apart&amp;quot;: Shopping List Made in 1984 Shows How N100 Was Used to Buy 20 Food Items, Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./18-best-sexy-perfumes-for-women-in-2024.html>18 Best Sexy Perfumes for Women in 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-joy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Bill Joy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billboard-will-stop-counting-artist-s-website-sales-towards-hot-100.html>Billboard Will Stop Counting Artist's Website Sales Towards Hot 100</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-carter-cause-of-death-who-was-billy-carter-how-jimmy-carter-brother-die.html>Billy Carter Cause Of Death Who Was Billy Carter?
