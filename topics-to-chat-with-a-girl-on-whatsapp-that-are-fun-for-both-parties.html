Any wrongly used one will end your conversation prematurely. Only use emojis if they know their purposes well.</li><li>Special compliments on the DP (display photo) will also ease the mode for conversation.</li><li>Make your chats and language as simple as possible (that is not the time to be a professor of English)</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c86ebb9222a9ef92.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>53 things to do with your girlfriend that will be fun for both of you</span></p></a><h2>Topics to chat with a girl on WhatsApp</h2><p class=align-left>Starting a conversation with a girl you like on WhatsApp needs you to balance the anxiety and still be interesting. How these first chats go will determine if you get blocked even before the relationship starts. Here are the interesting topics to chat about on WhatsApp with a girl.</p><h3>1. Hobbies</h3><p class=align-left>One of the best topics to chat with a girlfriend on WhatsApp is hobbies. Knowing how both of you spend your free time is a great way to understand each other. Common hobbies are always a point of conversation.</p><h3>2. Food</h3><p class=align-left>Food is one of the interesting topics to discuss with a girl and its a great icebreaker. Whether it’s a new dish you saw online or your favourite cuisine, chatting about food is a good starting point. You also get to know where to plan a date.</p><h3>3. Family</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/60a8e66c1565c224.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to compliment a girl: 50+ ways to make a lady feel special</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Conversations around family are great, and they show you are interested in the people she cares about. You can ask if she has siblings, which parent she is close to more, and how close she is to her family. You can share about your family as well.</p><h3>4. Work and career</h3><p class=align-left>This is an everyday life topic and is a good starting point. From horrible bosses and projects, you loved to office events, and talk about everything work-related. Ask her about her future work goals and share yours.</p><h3>5. Her communication style</h3><p class=align-left>Communication is the basis for a <a href=#>working relationship</a>. This makes it an important topic when getting to know someone. Is she a call or chat person, does she shut down when she is upset? You will avoid many conflicts and create a deeper connection with her once you understand her communication style.</p><h3>6. Future plans</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f50dd102a65997da.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>53 things to do with your boyfriend: fun ways to spend time together</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you are wondering how to keep a conversation going with a girl ask about her <a href=#>future</a> plans. Knowing what your girl's plans for the future are is a great way to create interest. Do not make this sound like an interview, but make it interesting.</p><p class=align-left>Dr. Sam emphasized that when discussing future plans with a girl you love, it's crucial to first establish a permanent definition for the relationship, among other key considerations, such as:</p><ul><li>It would be best to determine where the relationship is planned to end; that will help the extent of commitment.</li><li>Don't make commitments before discussing anything about future plans.</li><li>Initiate other real-life stories or even myths concerning the subjects you desire to discuss in the future and listen to her opinions in every respect.</li><li>The future of any subject must also be noted in the context of her demography.</li><li>It would help if you also tried to be in sync with the current realities of life expectancy before delving into how the future will look in every subject of life.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/52baf77206fcdf36.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a conversation with a guy: best openers to try out</span></p></a><h3>7. Fitness and health</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/11760bfb298ed4ec.png><p class=align-left>If you are big on health and fitness, bring up the topic and let her know what motivates you. You can ask about her favourite workout and how many times she hits the gym.</p><h3>8. Where she lives</h3><p class=align-left>Ask her about where she lives and what her immediate environment is like. Ensure you are not prying too much and always respect her privacy. Be general, and you don’t need to ask for her home address at this point.</p><h3>9. Day's events/happenings</h3><p class=align-left>Simple daily experiences can be the source of intriguing or light-hearted conversations. Ask her what were her rose, thorn, and bud. The rose is the best thing, the thorn is a negative thing, and the bud is a new insight she had.</p><h3>10. Habits and daily routines</h3><p class=align-left>Understanding her routines gives insight into how her life is structured. Ask what is her daily routine, and her favourite night-time ritual. This may even spark a thoughtful small gift idea for her. You also know a bit more about her daily schedule on when to text or call so you do not distract her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/669f664efa8fbb03.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>125+ funny things to say to break silence in any situation</span></p></a><h3>11. Role models</h3><p class=align-left>Ask who her biggest role model is. Find out who your potential girlfriend looks up to and who inspires her. Ask about the character traits she most admires in that person so you can understand her better. You can also share who your mentor or role model is.</p><h3>12. Travel plans</h3><p class=align-left>Travel topics are always great and fun if you don't know how to chat with a new girl on WhatsApp. Get to know where has she been and her next travel destination. See if your best destinations match or not, and maybe you can use this information to plan something in future. Some good questions to ask include:</p><ul><li>What is your favourite travel destination?</li><li>What cool thing(s) has travelling taught you?</li><li>If you could go anywhere with all expenses paid tomorrow, where would that be?</li></ul><h3>13. Intimacy</h3><p class=align-left>Intimacy is on of the most emotional topics to talk about with a girl. It's a hot topic, so save this for when both of you are comfortable with each other. This conversation is great to have at night because it can be steamy. Give her the space to talk about her feelings about what she likes or doesn’t like.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/51dcf84dd675f437.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is an exclusive relationship, and how should it work?</span></p></a><h3>14.

Pet Peeves</h3><p class=align-left>Pet peeves are a great topic to discuss when you do not know what to discuss with a girl. Get to know what bugs her and keep it light. This conversation will give you a chance to know what to avoid to win her over.</p><h3>16. Fashion</h3><p class=align-left>If you are not sure how to chat with a girl without being boring, try fashion.

Especially such that comes with painful memories.</li><li>You must also apologize when you notice a specific subject brings hurtful memories to the other person.</li><li>Whichever way those memories go (good or bad), make every effort to pick out the lessons from them and make them exciting experiences that you will end up appreciating God to have gone through.</li></ul><h3>21.
