Kennedy Jr.—knew her personal style through and through; she didn’t embrace trends—in actuality, she rejected them. Instead, she dedicated herself to silhouettes, brands, and specific pieces that inherently worked for her. It’s why her sublime sweaters, luxe coats, and subtle accessorizing still dominate our social media feeds 24 years after her untimely passing. Even I have a personal Pinterest board dedicated to her best looks that I reference every fall.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her style is finally properly documented in the new book CBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion, by Sunita Kumar Nair. The 256-page offering details the American icon’s personal style evolution, as well as exclusive conversations and essays from fashion industry veterans like Gabriela Hearst, Mario Sorrenti, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a45456133/yohji-yamamoto-interview-spring-2024-paris-fashion-week/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Yohji Yamamoto" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Yohji Yamamoto</u></a>, and many others reflecting on Kennedy’s sartorial legacy. It’s simply a must-read (and even <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/shopping/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a clever holiday gift" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>a clever holiday gift</u></a>) not just for longtime fans of Kennedy, but for any fashion aficionado who celebrates style that endures.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, Harper’s Bazaar shares an exclusive excerpt from the upcoming book, reflecting on Kennedy’s affinity for power dressing and Prada.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">The image of Carolyn wearing a vermilion-red checked Prada coat, blue jeans, and a black beanie, holding on to John, a streak of red also popping out from his scarf and hat, while walking their dog, Friday, is a monumental image of the couple, their style, and life in New York. There are many indelible images in my mind of Carolyn walking in New York, going about her daily business, and in most, she is wearing a coat—the majority of which are designed by Prada.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Most fashion designers have shared extensive discourses on their coat concepts because it carries a certain weight, both figuratively and materially, as a design piece. Yohji Yamamoto talks about how in the nineteenth century the winter was a very different experience to the poor. To them, owning one was essential to life, a protection from the elements. It is that need, to him, which is more important than the fashion aspect because it’s how the coat makes you “feel.” Dr. Valerie Steele, director of the Museum at FIT, agrees, saying that today “the functional component of the coat has been superseded by communication and symbolism; to speak about the ‘language’ of clothes is misleading, because it is more like ‘music’ as it creates a feeling or an ambience.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While a coat would certainly make you feel a certain way, the reality is we all now own at least five. Claire McCardell, an American fashion designer of the twentieth century who was pivotal to American fashion, runway and sportswear, believed in a “collection of coats, long ones, short ones, coats that are capes, warm ones, not so warm ones, textured, knitted fabrics … coats ride buses, they take cabs, when you walk down an aisle in the theatre, the audience has already judged you, so you want to be looking your best.”</p><img alt="john john kennedy and carolyn bessette in new york" title="JOHN JOHN KENNEDY AND CAROLYN BESSETTE IN NEW YORK" width=1024 height=1536 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/john-john-kennedy-and-carolyn-bessette-in-new-york-news-photo-1699283875.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lawrence Schwartzwald</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Women who are in the public eye, in front of a camera, are often politicians or royalty, have always used coats or dress coats as a focal point in their wardrobe. Carolyn’s mother-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, had already established it as her fashion precedent when she wore a scarlet double-faced wool Givenchy coat dress during the presidential campaign in 1959. Her predilection for Francophile fashion, however, had to be tempered for the inauguration. Hubert de Givenchy told Vogue that there were “many secret fittings … in case it was allowed.” He continues: “Jackie was very modern; her spirit was modern, she was a new image for America because he was a young president.” Jackie’s dress coats always had an overt ladylike quality to them, either in the details, buttons, color, finishing, or shape.</p><img alt="john f kennedy and his wife" title="John F.

Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy (wearing Givenchy) in 1960</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But Carolyn wasn’t going to go there, wearing any obvious saccharine trimmings or colors in her outerwear. She had her own coat song.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Carolyn’s red Prada coat is very Prada. The spring 1996 collection was based on a 1960s Formica kitchen print used on tiles, wallpaper, and curtains. The fashion reviews bordered on the acidic—you either loved or hated it. The collection, however, was considered the root to the Prada tree—led by a political feminist designer questioning the standard assumptions of beauty and luxury. Carolyn’s coat and color was not from the runway collection, but the print was comparable to another runway look, and it was made in John’s favorite color: red. The coat is Prada poetry at its best, a mocking wink on what we consider luxury. From every collection going forward, Mrs. Prada mixes fantasy and reality, functionality, and eccentricity. Textures, fabrics, embellishments, weights, values, traditions, and concepts are all at the mercy of Mrs. Prada’s intellectual eye.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“I prefer to express my whimsy in coats.” —Miuccia Prada <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Friends of Carolyn’s have often said that she was keen to deflect from her beauty, and the house’s modus operandi was the perfect conduit for her, as well as its position as the label of the nineties.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After her marriage to John, Carolyn chose Prada coats over any other fashion house. She goes as far as having two color variations of the same style: a military double-faced wool coat made in black and camel. The shoulder epaulettes, the belt, and the three-quarter-length silhouette offer a state of protection for the wearer. Mrs. Prada has often said that she wants the women who wear her clothes to feel brave, to be able to face their dreams and their fantasies.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1996, Carolyn uncharacteristically wore a green-checked Valentino coat for Jackie’s memorial service—a color that she rarely wore, and perhaps another gift from John during their Milan trip in 1997. Giancarlo Giacometti, partner to Valentino, agreed it was likely a boutique version of the fall 1996 runway coat. Her other coat contenders included a vintage leopard print, an astrakhan fur by Ann Demeulemeester, and one of her last coats, of course, a Yohji Yamamoto raincoat, which she wore in May 1999.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Excerpt from the new book CBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion, by Sunita Kumar Nair, published by Abrams © 2023 H11, Inc.</p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0"><i>CBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion</i>, by Sunita Kumar Nair</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$41 at Amazon for iCBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion/i, by Sunita Kumar Nair" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1419767194 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1419767194 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1419767194 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","is_active":true,"details":null,"metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241365+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241381+00:00"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$41 at Amazon" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1419767194 data-vars-ga-product-id=2b27374e-60de-4ea7-81be-ccbdc95dcd5d data-vars-ga-product-price=$41.37 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=a3d1e181-3a5d-4331-b96a-bfd5b87f4e20 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | On Sale" data-vars-ga-sku=1419767194 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="iCBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion/i, by Sunita Kumar Nair" title="iCBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion/i, by Sunita Kumar Nair" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1698678688-81TT4ObPX0L.jpg width=2058 height=2560 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0"><i>CBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion</i>, by Sunita Kumar Nair</h2></p><p>Now 36% Off</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
