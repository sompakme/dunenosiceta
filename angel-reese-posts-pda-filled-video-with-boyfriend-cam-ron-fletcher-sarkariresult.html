Fans have swiftly conjectured that Reese might be expecting a child due to her subpar performance on the court and multiple game-day absences.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>Rumors started circulating when Reese was sidelined during the Kent State game and subsequently excluded from the lineup against Texas Southern. LSU’s head coach, Kim Mulkey, hasn’t disclosed any precise reasons for Reese’s non-participation, merely alluding to internal matters.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>On social media, speculation has run rampant, with numerous individuals hastily presuming that Reese’s absence may be linked to a pregnancy. A few fans have referenced her recent remarks about avoiding campus strolls, hinting at potential academic concerns. Nevertheless, there’s no definitive evidence to substantiate these assertions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-reese-s-response-and-relationship>Reese’s Response and Relationship</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>Reese’s continued silence regarding the swirling speculations surrounding her absence has only added fuel to the rumor mill. Fans have taken to social media platforms to express their opinions, with some adamantly asserting that her pregnancy is evident, and she may no longer wish to pursue a basketball career.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>It’s noteworthy that Reese has maintained a relatively low profile on social media and has refrained from directly addressing the rumors. However, she did post a cryptic message on X, urging her followers not to blindly believe everything they come across.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>In addition to the pregnancy rumors, fans have also shifted their focus to Reese’s relationship with her boyfriend, Cam’Ron Fletcher, with whom she has been in a relationship for approximately six years. The couple frequently shares videos of their activities on platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Fletcher, himself an athlete who enjoyed a successful season with the Florida State Seminoles before suffering an ACL injury, has also garnered attention in light of Reese’s situation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-awaiting-official-statement>Awaiting Official Statement</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>As of now, the cause of Angel Reese’s absence from the LSU lineup remains a mystery. It is vital to exercise caution and refrain from prematurely jumping to conclusions or disseminating unfounded rumors. Until Reese or the LSU coaching staff issues an official statement, any speculations regarding her absence should be treated as just that—speculations. Respecting her privacy and allowing her to address the situation on her own terms is of utmost importance.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>In summary, while fans engage in conjecture about the reasons behind Angel Reese’s recent game absences, particularly regarding the possibility of pregnancy, it is imperative to await credible information before making any judgments.
